153,"<jats:p>PbTe single crystals doped with monovalent Au or Cu were grown using the Bridgman method. Far infrared reflectivity spectra were measured at room temperature for all samples and plasma minima were registered. These experimental spectra were numerically analyzed and optical parameters were calculated. All the samples of PbTe doped with Au or Cu were of the “<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>” type. The properties of these compositions were analyzed and compared with PbTe containing other dopants. The samples of PbTe doped with only 3.3 at% Au were the best among the PbTe + Au samples having the lowest plasma frequency and the highest mobility of free carriers-electrons, while PbTe doped with Cu was the opposite. Samples with the lowest Cu concentration of 0.23 at% Cu had the best properties. Thermal diffusivity and electronic transport properties of the same PbTe doped samples were also investigated using a photoacoustic (PA) method with the transmission detection configuration. The results obtained with the far infrared and photoacoustic characterization of PbTe doped samples were compared and discussed. Both methods confirmed that when PbTe was doped with 3.3 at% Au, thermoelectric and electrical properties of this doped semiconductor were both significantly improved, so Au as a dopant in PbTe could be used as a new high quality thermoelectric material.</jats:p>"

            <jats:p>Thermoelectric materials based on non-toxic and earth-abundant elements are important from the viewpoint of energy harvesting from the widely-spread waste heat. We have investigated the thermoelectric properties of Cu<jats:sub>9</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>9</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>16</jats:sub>, known as the natural mineral mooihoekite or talnakhite. Seebeck coefficient shows a large negative value of about -140 μV/K around room temperature. Thermal conductivity is found to be as small as 2.0 W/Km above 100 K, which is attributed to the large unit cell and the complicated crystal structure. Our results indicate that Cu<jats:sub>9</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>9</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>16</jats:sub> can make a high-performance and environmentally-friendly thermoelectric material if the concentration of carriers, especially holes, is reduced.</jats:p>"

1503,"<jats:p>Orientation distributions of cobaltite thermoelectric and polyphased bismuth-based cuprate superconducting textured materials are determined from neutron and X-ray diffraction analysis. Curved position-sensitive detectors coupled to a tilt-angle (χ) scan enable the treatment of the whole diffraction pattern using the combined Rietveld–WIMV–Popa algorithm. The textures of three phases of superconducting compounds are determined. The critical current densities, measured for four samples, are strongly dependent on the calculated texture strengths, crystallite sizes and phase ratios. For the cobaltite compounds, a comparison between X-ray and neutron analysis shows the advantages of the latter technique for avoiding the limitations of the X-ray analysis with respect to the defocusing effect. The results highlight the necessity and efficiency of the combined approach for a quantitative texture analysis of complex materials and exemplify the texture–anisotropic physical properties relationship for a better understanding and design of improved bulk superconducting and thermoelectric materials.</jats:p>"

2657,"<jats:p>The electrical and thermal conductivities and the Seebeck coefficient of mesoporous ZnO thin films were investigated to determine the change of their thermoelectric properties by controlling surfactant concentration in the mesoporous ZnO films, because the thermoelectric properties of mesoporous ZnO films can be influenced by the porosity of the mesoporous structures, which is primarily determined by surfactant concentration in the films. Mesoporous ZnO thin films were successfully synthesized by using sol-gel and evaporation-induced self-assembly processes. Zinc acetate dihydrate and Brij-76 were used as the starting material and pore structure-forming template, respectively. The porosity of mesoporous ZnO thin films increased from 29% to 40% with increasing surfactant molar ratio. Porosity can be easily altered by controlling the molar ratio of surfactant/precursor. The electrical and thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficients showed a close correlation with the porosity of the films, indicating that the thermoelectric properties of thin films can be changed by altering their porosity. Mesoporous ZnO thin films with the highest porosity had the best thermoelectric properties (the lowest thermal conductivity and the highest Seebeck coefficient) of the films examined.</jats:p>"

High-temperature resistivity studies were performed to confirm the semiconductivity of buckypaper.

The skutterudite powders were processed by melt spinning, followed by ball milling and annealing. The n-type material consists of Ba–Yb–Co–Sb and the p-type material consists of Di–Fe–Ni–Sb or Di–Fe–Co–Sb (Di = didymium, an alloy of Pr and Nd). Powders for prototype module fabrication from General Motors and Marlow Industries were analyzed in this study. XRD and neutron diffraction studies confirm that both the n- and p-type materials have cubic symmetry. Structural Rietveld refinements determined the lattice parameters and atomic parameters of the framework and filler atoms. The cage filling fraction was found to depend linearly on the lattice parameter, which in turn depends on the average framework atom size. This knowledge may allow the filling fraction of these skutterudite materials to be purposefully adjusted, thereby tuning the thermoelectric properties.</jats:p>"

4736,"<jats:p>CoSb<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>is an example of a highly challenging case for experimental charge-density analysis due to the heavy elements (suitability factor of ∼0.01), the perfect crystallinity and the high symmetry of the compound. It is part of a family of host–guest structures that are potential candidates for use as high-performance thermoelectric materials. Obtaining and analysing accurate charge densities of the undoped host structure potentially can improve the understanding of the thermoelectric properties of this family of materials. In a previous study, analysis of the electron density gave a picture of covalent Co–Sb and Sb–Sb interactions together with relatively low atomic charges based on state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical data. In the current study, several experimental X-ray diffraction data sets collected on the empty CoSb<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>framework are compared in order to probe the experimental requirements for obtaining data of high enough quality for charge-density analysis even in the case of very unsuitable crystals. Furthermore, the quality of the experimental structure factors is tested by comparison with theoretical structure factors obtained from periodic DFT calculations. The results clearly show that, in the current study, the data collected on high-intensity, high-energy synchrotron sources and very small crystals are superior to data collected at conventional sources, and in fact necessary for a meaningful charge-density study, primarily due to greatly diminished effects of extinction and absorption which are difficult to correct for with sufficient accuracy.</jats:p>"
4737,"<jats:p>Subtle structural features such as disorder and anharmonic motion may be accurately characterized from nuclear density distributions (NDDs). As a viable alternative to neutron diffraction, this paper introduces a new approach named the nuclear-weighted X-ray maximum entropy method (NXMEM) for reconstructing pseudo NDDs. It calculates an electron-weighted nuclear density distribution (eNDD), exploiting that X-ray diffraction delivers data of superior quality, requires smaller sample volumes and has higher availability. NXMEM is tested on two widely different systems: PbTe and Ba<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>16</jats:sub>Sn<jats:sub>30</jats:sub>. The first compound, PbTe, possesses a deceptively simple crystal structure on the macroscopic level that is unable to account for its excellent thermoelectric properties. The key mechanism involves local distortions, and the capability of NXMEM to probe this intriguing feature is established with simulated powder diffraction data. In the second compound, Ba<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>Ga<jats:sub>16</jats:sub>Sn<jats:sub>30</jats:sub>, disorder among the Ba guest atoms is analysed with both experimental and simulated single-crystal diffraction data. In all cases, NXMEM outperforms the maximum entropy method by substantially enhancing the nuclear resolution. The induced improvements correlate with the amount of available data, rendering NXMEM especially powerful for powder and low-resolution single-crystal diffraction. The NXMEM procedure can be implemented in existing software and facilitates widespread characterization of disorder in functional materials.</jats:p>"

Specifically, SnSe has been reported to have an ultrahigh thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.6 ± 0.3 in the high-temperature phase. Here we report the evolution of lattice constants, fractional coordinates, site occupancy factors and atomic displacement factors with temperature by means of high-resolution synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measured from 100 to 855 K. The structure is shown to be cation defective with a Sn content of 0.982 (4). The anisotropy of the thermal parameters of Sn becomes more pronounced approaching the high-temperature phase transition (∼ 810 K). Anharmonic Gram–Charlier parameters have been refined, but data from single-crystal diffraction appear to be needed to firmly quantify anharmonic features. Based on modelling of the atomic displacement parameters the Debye temperature is found to be 175 (4) K. Conflicting reports concerning the different coordinate system settings in the low-temperature and high-temperature phases are discussed.

5350,"<jats:p>SOx and NOx are emissions resulting from combustion processes and are the main agents that contribute to the formation of acid rain, which causes harm to humans and the environment. Several techniques for removing these pollutants are applied in i.e. oil refineries, thermoelectric that use petroleum oils and vehicular pollution. Among these, highlight the adsorption of contaminants by the usage of activated carbon fibers and activated carbon, which are characterized by high surface area and uniform distribution of pores, providing appropriate conditions for application in processes of removing environmental contaminants. In the present work, activated viscose fibers (AVF) were prepared and applied in adsorption experiments of NO and SO2. The materials produced showed high values of surface area, with a predominance of micro pores with diameters in the range of 1.0 nm. The AVF had satisfactory performance in the removal of contaminants and are compatible with other synthetic fibers. Thus, the formation of active sites of carbon provides contaminants adsorption, demonstrating that carbon fibers cloth can be applied for the removal of pollutants.</jats:p>"

These materials are quarried from natural sources. Their depletion will cause strain on the environment. To prevent this, bottom ash produced at thermal power plants by burning of coal has been utilized in this investigation into making concrete. The experimental investigation presents the development of concrete containing lignite coal bottom ash as fine aggregate in various percentages of 25, 50, and 100. Compressive, split tensile, and flexural strength as part of mechanical properties; acid, sulphate attack, and sustainability under elevated temperature as part of durability properties, were determined. These properties were compared with that of normal concrete. It was concluded from this investigation that bottom ash to an extent of 25% can be substituted in place of river sand in the production of concrete.</jats:p>"

The influence of dopants and hydrothermal treatment conditions on the formation features, phase composition, particle size, morphology and properties of the products were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and electrical measurements. This paper reports a comparative study regarding the dopants influence to the shape and size of nano-structured thermoelectric materials. It was found that hydrothermal processing results in formation of low dimensional dispersion of doped Bi2Te3 nanostructures with desired shape and size and high degree of crystallinity with typical semiconductor behavior.</jats:p>"

7072,"<p>Oxide diffusion was studied in two innovative SOFC cathode materials, Ba<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>9</sub>O<sub>14</sub> and Ca<sub>3</sub>Co<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9+δ</sub> derivatives. Although oxygen diffusion was confirmed in the promising material Ba<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>9</sub>O<sub>14</sub>, it was not possible to derive accurate transport parameters because of an oxidation process at the sample surface which has still to be clarified. In contrast, oxygen diffusion in the well-known Ca<sub>3</sub>Co<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9+δ</sub> thermoelectric material was improved when calcium was partly substituted with strontium, likely due to an increase of the volume of the rock salt layers in which the conduction process takes place. Although the diffusion coefficient remains low, interestingly, fast kinetics towards the oxygen molecule dissociation reaction were shown with surface exchange coefficients higher than those reported for the best cathode materials in the field. They increased with the strontium content; the Sr atoms potentially play a key role in the mechanism of oxygen molecule dissociation at the solid surface.</p>"

8203,"<jats:p>SnTe is a promising thermoelectric and topological insulator material. Here, the presumably simple rock salt crystal structure of SnTe is studied comprehensively by means of high-resolution synchrotron single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction from 20 to 800 K. Two samples with different carrier concentrations (sample<jats:italic>A</jats:italic>= high, sample<jats:italic>B</jats:italic>= low) have remarkably different atomic displacement parameters, especially at low temperatures. Both samples contain significant numbers of cation vacancies (1–2%) and ordering of Sn vacancies possibly occurs on warming, as corroborated by the appearance of multiple phases and strain above 400 K. The possible presence of disorder and anharmonicity is investigated in view of the low thermal conductivity of SnTe. Refinement of anharmonic Gram–Charlier parameters reveals marginal anharmonicity for sample<jats:italic>A</jats:italic>, whereas sample<jats:italic>B</jats:italic>exhibits anharmonic effects even at low temperature. For both samples, no indications are found of a low-temperature rhombohedral phase. Maximum entropy method (MEM) calculations are carried out, including nuclear-weighted X-ray MEM calculations (NXMEM). The atomic electron densities are spherical for sample<jats:italic>A</jats:italic>, whereas for sample<jats:italic>B</jats:italic>the Te electron density is elongated along the 〈100〉 direction, with the maximum being displaced from the lattice position at higher temperatures. Overall, the crystal structure of SnTe is found to be defective and sample-dependent, and therefore theoretical calculations of perfect rock salt structures are not expected to predict the properties of real materials.</jats:p>"

8794,"<jats:p>The growth of good quality bulk single crystals of bismuth selenide by employing a high-temperature vertical Bridgman technique with a specially designed ampoule having a provision for a necking process is reported. Several growth experiments were performed and reproducible results were obtained. The crystal structure and lattice dimensions were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), the bulk crystalline perfection was assessed using high-resolution X-ray diffractometry and the good bulk crystalline perfection with an indication of layered structure was confirmed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out for the grown single crystal and confirmed the layered structure. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) was also used to further assess the crystalline perfection. The direct measurement of<jats:italic>d</jats:italic>spacing obtained from HRTEM imaging was found to be in good agreement with the data obtained from PXRD. The thermal behavior was examined by differential scanning calorimetry and a sharp melting was found at 983 K, which revealed the purity of the bismuth selenide. The Seebeck coefficient and electrical and thermal conductivities were measured, and a thermoelectric figure of merit was calculated in order to assess the suitability of the crystal for thermoelectric applications such as refrigeration and portable power generation. Nanoindentation analysis was also performed for the first time.</jats:p>"

The experimental results revealed that the applied magnetic field modified the morphology and orientation of both the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu dendrite and the Al–Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu eutectic significantly. The magnetic field caused a break in the Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu dendrite and the degeneration of Al–Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu eutectic lamellae during directional solidification. It was also found that the magnetic field caused the formation of dislocations in the α-Al and Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu phases during directional solidification. In addition, the primary and eutectic Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu phases were oriented with the 〈001〉 crystal direction along the magnetic field during volume solidification. Both α-Al and Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Cu phases were oriented with the 〈001〉 crystal direction along the solidification direction during directional solidification under an axial magnetic field. The above phenomena were enhanced as the magnetic field increased; this could be attributed to magnetic crystalline anisotropy of the material and thermoelectric magnetic effects. This study may offer experimental evidence that shows that thermoelectric magnetic effects significantly influence dendrite arrays during directional solidification in a magnetic field.</jats:p>"

Specifically, we examined actin filament sliding—with or without human cardiac troponin (Tn) and α-tropomyosin (Tm)—propelled by rabbit skeletal heavy meromyosin, when temperature was varied continuously over a wide range (∼20–63<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>C</mml:mtext><mml:mo>°</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math>). At the upper end of this temperature range, reversible dysregulation of thin filaments occurred at pCa 9 and 5; actomyosin function was unaffected. Tn-Tm enhanced sliding speed at pCa 5 and increased a transition temperature (<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>) between a high activation energy (<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>) but low temperature regime and a low<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>but high temperature regime.

However, these models must be valued to identify main design parameters that more efficiently control the electrical properties of the materials to be developed. In this paper, four different models used for modeling DC electrical conductivity of carbon nanotube-polymer composites are studied with the aim of obtaining a complete list of design parameters that allow guarantying to the designer an increase in electrical properties of the composite by means of carbon nanotubes.</jats:p>"

10730,"<jats:p>The world energy crisis had increased the demand for alternative energy sources and as such is one of the topics at the forefront of research. One way for reducing energy consumption is by thermoelectricity. Thermoelectric effects enable direct conversion of thermal into electrical energy. Higher manganese silicide (HMS, MnSi<jats:sub>1.75</jats:sub>) is one of the promising materials for applications in the field of thermoelectricity. The abundance and low cost of the elements, combined with good thermoelectric properties and high mechanical and chemical stability at high temperatures, make it very attractive for thermoelectric applications. Recent studies have shown that Si-rich HMS has improved thermoelectric properties. The most interesting of which is the unusual reduction in thermal conductivity. In the current research, transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction methods were applied for investigation of the govern mechanisms resulting in very low thermal conductivity values of an Si-rich HMS composition, following arc melting and hot-pressing procedures. In this paper, it is shown that there is a presence of sub-micron dislocations walls, stacking faults, and silicon and HMS precipitates inside each other apparent in the matrix, following a high temperature (0.9 Tm) hot pressing for an hour.

The Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and power factor (PF) were measured at room temperature. The experimental results showed that the Seebeck coefficient increased and conductivity decreased with increasing evaporation current. The Seebeck coefficient reached a maximum of 387.58 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>V/K at an evaporation current of 80 A. Conversely, a PF of 3.57 <jats:italic>µ</jats:italic>W/cmK<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>was obtained at room temperature with evaporation current of 60 A.</jats:p>"
10736,"<jats:p>Investigating the charge transport behavior in one-dimensional quantum confined system such as the localized states and interference effects due to the nanoscale grain boundaries and merged domains in wide chemical vapor deposition graphene constriction is highly desirable since it would help to realize industrial graphene-based electronic device applications. Our data suggests a crossover from interference coherent transport to carriers flushing into grain boundaries and merged domains when increasing the current. Moreover, many-body fermionic carriers with disordered system in our case can be statistically described by mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation via a single wave function by means of the quantum hydrodynamic approximation. The novel numerical simulation method supports the experimental results and suggests that the extreme high barrier potential regions on graphene from the grain boundaries and merged domains can be strongly affected by additional hot charges. Such interesting results could pave the way for quantum transport device by supplying additional hot current to flood into the grain boundaries and merged domains in one-dimensional quantum confined CVD graphene, a great advantage for developing graphene-based coherent electronic devices.</jats:p>"

10738,"<jats:p>Ballistic thermal transport properties are investigated comparatively for out-of-plane phonon modes (FPMs) and in-plane phonon modes (IPMs) in bended graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). Results show that the phonon modes transports can be modulated separately by the phonon dispersion mismatch between armchair and zigzag GNRs in considered system. The contribution of FPMs to total thermal conductance is larger than 50% in low temperature for perfect GNRs. But it becomes less than 20% in the bended GNRs. Furthermore, this contribution can be modulated by changing the structural parameters of the bended GNRs. The result is useful for the design of thermal or thermoelectric nanodevices in future.</jats:p>"

The simulations of different structures (including boron doping, germanium concentrations, and SiGe layer thickness) have been conducted. The critical thickness of SiGe layer grown on silicon substrate has also been illustrated in the paper.

Each layer of the material is clear in the SEM.

The TCR was about −3.7%/K at room temperature in the experiments, which is competitive with the other thermistor materials. The material is a low noise material, whose root mean square noise is 1.89 mV in the experiments.</jats:p>"

The main idea is to prepare a composite hybrid DSSC photoanode which can simultaneously achieve PV and TE conversion by incorporating the excellent TE Bi-Te alloys into TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>nanomaterial. In this paper, Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>nanoplates with different size were doped in the TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>nanoparticle photoanode and the effect of the Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>size on the properties of DSSCs was analyzed. It is found that with the decrease of the size of the Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>nanoplates, the TE performance became better and the dye absorption and the conversion efficiency of DSSCs were improved. Preliminary results show that the efficiency of DSSC with Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>increased atleast 15.3% compared to the undoped. By further optimizing the parameters, the performance of DSSC is estimated to have a much more enhancement. Therefore, the way of combination PV and TE provides an alternative way to improve the performance of DSSC.</jats:p>"

            <jats:p>The materials class of skutterudites is one of the promising thermoelectric materials due to its decent electronic properties and cage-like structural feature that can be filled with guest atoms. First principles calculations have been performed in order to investigate electronic band structures and related transport properties of pnictogen-substitued skutterudites filled with alkaline-earth elements (M<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>Co<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>A<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>6</jats:sub> where M=Ca, Sr, or Ba, A=Ge or Sn, and x=0.5 or 1). The Seebeck coefficient and the power factor, which are electronic transport properties related to thermoelectricity, are computed by using the Boltzmann transport formalism within the constant-relaxation-time-approximation. The results are compared against the corresponding properties of the unfilled pnictogen-substitued ternary skutterudites (CoA<jats:sub>1.5</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>1.5</jats:sub>) to identify the effects of filling, based on which the potential of filled pnictogen-substituted skutterudites for thermoelectric applications is evaluated. The possible changes in the ionic character of the interatomic bonding, which was suspected to be an important scattering source, are probed by analyzing the projected density of states.</jats:p>"

Assembly of nanoparticles obtained by a solution route is an attractive bulk fabrication method because size and shape of the nanoparticles can be tuned by variation of the synthesis conditions.

X-ray diffraction studies conducted on powder and pellet samples show that two alloyed phases are present in the sample even at low selenium content. The careful study of the position of the diffraction peaks as function of the formulation shows that this behaviour could arise from the difference in reactivity of selenium and tellurium. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of the samples is shown to increase upon selenium addition while the Seebeck coefficient is reduced. Power factor shows an optimum value around 20% selenium content with a large tolerance in composition.</jats:p>"

However, challenges still exist in accurately predicting the mean free paths (MFPs) of electrons and phonons in a high-throughput frame for thermoelectric property predictions, which largely hinders the computation-driven search for novel materials. In this work, this need is eliminated under the small-grain-size limit, in which these MFPs are restricted by the grain sizes within a bulk material.

As the ionic radius of Pb<jats:sup>2+</jats:sup>is greater than that of Bi<jats:sup>3+</jats:sup>, the unit-cell volume of Bi<jats:sub>1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>Pb<jats:sub><jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>OCuSe increases progressively from<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>= 0 to 0.1, namely, from 137.868(5) to 139.172(11) Å<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, as expected. The structure of Bi<jats:sub>1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>Pb<jats:sub><jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>OCuSe is built from [Bi<jats:sub>2(1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)</jats:sub>Pb<jats:sub>2<jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>2(1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)+</jats:sup>layers normal to the<jats:italic>c</jats:italic>-axis alternating with [Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Se<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>2(1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)−</jats:sup>fluorite-like layers. Pb substitution in the Bi site of Bi<jats:sub>1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>Pb<jats:sub><jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>OCuSe leads to the weakening of the “bonding” between the [Bi<jats:sub>2(1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)</jats:sub>Pb<jats:sub>2<jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>2(1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)+</jats:sup>and the [Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Se<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>]<jats:sup>2(1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)−</jats:sup>layers. Powder patterns of Bi<jats:sub>1−<jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>Pb<jats:sub><jats:italic>x</jats:italic></jats:sub>OCuSe were submitted to be included in the Powder Diffraction File.</jats:p>"

For efficient high energy Yb:YAG laser operation, the laser crystals are required to be cooled at cryogenic temperatures due to the material’s excellent thermo-optic and spectroscopic properties at these temperatures. In our case, the laser was designed for operation at 150 K with maximum heat load of 300 W to be removed from the laser crystals. At this
temperature, the cooling system was capable of dynamically removing the waste heat arising in the Yb:YAG active medium as a result of optical pumping, while keeping the temperature stability within +/- 0.1 K."

O objetivo deste artigo é investigar as representações sociais que grupos e atores sociais no espaço rural compartilham em torno da temática da exploração do carvão mineral no município de Candiota (RS), sul do Brasil. Foi possível identificar algumas representações que compõem a relação entre o rural e o carvão no município. Do ponto de vista teórico e metodológico, optou-se pela Teoria das Representações Sociais, de Serge Moscovici, e pela abordagem estrutural das representações sociais de Jean-Claude Abric. Foram entrevistadas 46 pessoas entre janeiro e março de 2012. A representação central da atividade carbonífera no caso estudado situa-se em torno da ideia de ""crescimento econômico"", retratando um discurso embasado no universo reificado de alguns setores socioeconômicos e a pressão à inferência sobre grupos. Os entrevistados, em sua maioria, são favoráveis à atividade (53%), enquanto 28% são contrários e 19% não se consideram nem favoráveis nem contrários, variando seus argumentos conforme a posição social. No caso estudado, o grau de dependência em relação à exploração do carvão é instável e dinâmico.</jats:p>"
15596,"<jats:p>Falhas em tubos de caldeiras são as maiores causas de paradas forçadas de unidades de geração termelétrica, sendo que a espessura da camada de óxido, que se forma na parede interna destes tubos é a principal causadora de falhas por sobreaquecimento. A partir dos valores medidos da camada interna de óxidos é possível estimar a vida residual do componente através de correlações com parâmetros já estabelecidos na comunidade científica. O Cepel vem desenvolvendo metodologias para estimativa de vida residual de componentes de caldeiras de usinas termelétricas, seguindo as tendências mundiais e as necessidades de seus clientes no Brasil. Com a recente aquisição de equipamento para detecção de defeitos e medições de espessura via ultrassom, tornou-se possível realizar medidas de espessura tanto da parede das tubulações das caldeiras como da camada interna de óxidos presente nas mesmas. O presente artigo apresenta uma comparação entre os resultados de medições de espessura de camada de óxidos em tubos pela técnica não destrutiva de ultrassom e pela técnica destrutiva de metalografia associada à microscopia ótica, em diferentes faixas de espessura da camada e análise do efeito do acabamento superficial na confiabilidade destes resultados por ultrassom. Finalmente, o trabalho analisa de maneira crítica os resultados de vida remanescente, obtidos a partir da medição espessura de camada de óxido. Para esta análise tomou-se como base tubos de uma mesma unidade geradora com diferentes valores de camada de óxido e com o mesmo tempo de operação.</jats:p>"

O objetivo deste trabalho foi sintetizar e caracterizar pós e filmes finos amorfos de titanato de bário (BaTiO3), por meio do método Pechini. Esses pós foram caracterizados via Análise Térmica (TG/DSC) e Difração de Raios X (DRX). A temperatura utilizada no tratamento térmico dos pós foi de 400°C a 800°C dependendo da amostra, durante 10 horas. A análise estrutural de DRX revelou um aumento da linha espectral, que pode ser observada em alguns difratogramas, próxima do ângulo de 30° em 2q, sugerindo uma maior cristalinidade e um aumento do tamanho do cristalito provocado pelo aumento da temperatura de calcinação. Essas análises indicaram também a presença de BaCO3, além disso, observou-se a formação de apenas um pico próximo a 45° em 2q, sugerindo a formação de titanato com fase cúbica. A partir dos difratogramas foi calculado o tamanho de grão, o resultado obtido foi da ordem de 20 nm. Os filmes finos de BaTiO3 foram depositados via Dip Coating. Esses filmes foram analisados por meio da Microscopia de Força Atômica (AFM). Esta técnica permitiu observar aglomerações de partículas em todos os filmes. A superfície desses filmes apresentou alterações significativas em sua rugosidade com aumento da temperatura de tratamento térmico dos filmes.</jats:p>"

The results showed that the order of modal shapes had an important influence on the optimization results. The difference of these two methods on the sensor placement optimization became smaller with the decrease of the number of target modes. The final scheme of OSP was determined based on the optimal results and the actual test requirements. The field test results were basically consistent with the finite element analysis results, which indicated the sensor placement optimization for vibration test on the medium-speed mill was feasible.</jats:p>"

16600,<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The progressing miniaturisation and increasing power demand of microelectronic devices require efficient cooling systems to avoid thermal damage. Future cooling systems have to be capable of dealing with heat loads of more than 200 W/cm</jats:p>

16603,"<jats:p>A first-principle plane-wave pseudopotential method based on the density function theory (DFT) was employed to investigate the effects of vacancy cluster (VC) defects on the band structure and thermoelectric properties of silicon (Si) crystals. Simulation results showed that various VC defects changed the energy band and localized electron density distribution of Si crystals and caused the band gap to decrease with increasing VC size. The results can be ascribed to the formation of a defect level produced by the dangling bonds, floating bonds, or high-strain atoms surrounding the VC defects. The appearance of imaginary frequencies in the phonon spectrum of defective Si crystals indicates that the defect-region structure is dynamically unstable and demonstrates phase changes. The phonon dispersion relation and phonon density of state were also investigated using density functional perturbation theory. The obtained Debye temperature<mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M1""><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators=""|""><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math>for a perfect Si crystal had a minimum value of 448 K at<jats:italic>T</jats:italic>= 42 K and a maximum value of 671 K at the high-temperature limit, which is consistent with the experimental results reported by Flubacher. Moreover, the Debye temperature decreased with increases in the VC size. VC defects had minimal effects on the heat capacity (<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:italic><jats:sub>v</jats:sub></jats:italic>) value when temperatures were below 150 K. As the temperature was higher than 150 K, the heat capacity gradually increased with increasing temperature until it achieved a constant value of 11.8 cal/cell·K. The heat capacity significantly decreased as the VC size increased. For a 2 × 2 × 2 superlattice Si crystal containing a hexagonal ring VC (HRVC10), the heat capacity decreased by approximately 17%.</jats:p>"

The thermoelectric performance of PbS obtained in this study is comparable to that of a PbS sample prepared by conventional method. The carrier type and concentration of PbS can be tuned effectively by doping with Bi. The maximum figure of merit for PbS doped with 1 mol% Bi reaches 0.44 at 550 K, which is about 30 % higher than that of undoped PbS.

This scalable synthesis route provides nano-engineered material with less impact on the environment compared to conventional synthesis procedures. Several Fe substituted compositions have been synthesized to confirm the feasibility of the process. The process consists of a nano-sized precursor fabrication of iron and cobalt oxalate, and antimony oxides by chemical co-precipitation. Further thermochemical processes result in the formation of iron substituted skutterudites. The nanopowders are compacted by Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique in order to maintain nanostructure. Detailed physicochemical as well as thermoelectric transport properties are evaluated. Results reveal strongly reduced thermal conductivity values compared to conventionally prepared counterparts, due to nanostructuring. P-type characteristic was observed from the Seebeck measurements while electrical conductivity is high and shows metallic behavior. The highest TE figure of merit of 0.25 at 800 K has been achieved, which is strongly enhanced with respect to the mother compound CoSb3.

Temperature dependence of thermoelectric properties of the nanostructured bulk sample was investigated in the range of 300-450K. The presence of nanograins in the bulk sample exhibits a reduction of thermal conductivity and less effect on electrical conductivity. As a result, a figure of merit of the sintered bulk sample reached 0.2 at 400 K.

17617,"<jats:p>The fundamental understanding of the influence of molecular structure on the carrier transport properties in the field of organic thermoelectrics (OTEs) is a big challenge since the carrier transport behavior in conducting polymers reveals average properties contributed from all carrier transport channels, including those through intra-chain, inter-chain, inter-grain, and hopping between disordered localized sites. Here, combining molecular dynamics simulations and experiments, we investigated the carrier transport properties of doped highly oriented poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films with different side-chain regioregularity. It is demonstrated that the substitution of side chains can not only take effect on the carrier transport edge, but also on the dimensionality of the transport paths and as a result, on the carrier mobility. Conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) study as well as temperature-dependent measurements of the electrical conductivity clearly showed ordered local current paths in the regular side chain P3HT films, while random paths prevailed in the irregular sample. Regular side chain substitution can be activated more easily and favors one-dimensional transport along the backbone chain direction, while the irregular sample presents the three-dimensional electron hopping behavior. As a consequence, the regular side chain P3HT samples demonstrated high carrier mobility of 2.9 ± 0.3 cm2/V·s, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than that in irregular side chain P3HT films, resulting in a maximum thermoelectric (TE) power factor of 39.1 ± 2.5 μW/mK2 at room temperature.

Given the very small size and low strength exhibited by single crystals, grain-oriented Ca3Co4O9 ceramics are worth elaborating to capitalize on their anisotropy. However, the usual textured pellets are too thin to probe the TE properties along their principal crystallographic directions. In this paper, we report on the anisotropy of TE properties in the 350–860 K range within thick textured Ca3Co4O9 ceramics fabricated by moderately pressing at 1173 K stacks of pellets primarily textured using spark plasma sintering (SPS), spark plasma texturing (SPT), and hot pressing (HP). The texture was quantitatively assessed, and the influent microstructural parameters were identified, particularly the grain boundary density parallel (GBDc) and perpendicular (GBDab) to the mean c*-axis. We found that the edge-free processing fostered material texturing and (a,b) plane grain growth, thereby dropping GBDab and increasing GBDc. This resulted in a resistivity ρab reduction, leading to a marked enhancement in power factor PFab, which reached 520 μW·m−1·K−2 at 800 K for the HP sample. The anisotropy ρc/ρab was substantially promoted as the texture was reinforced and the GBDc/GBDab ratio increased, with ρc/ρab (HP) &gt; ρc/ρab (SPT) &gt; ρc/ρab (SPS). The Seebeck coefficient S also revealed an anisotropic behavior, with a ratio Sc/Sab &gt;1 for the SPS-processed materials. This behavior was reversed (Sc/Sab &lt;1) for the more textured SPT and HP specimens. It therefore resulted in a PF anisotropy PFc/PFab (HP) &lt; PFc/PFab (SPT) &lt; PFc/PFab (SPS). The PFab/PFc ratio attained 13.6 at 800 K for the thick HP sample, which is the largest ratio recorded thus far on undoped Ca3Co4O9 ceramics.</jats:p>"

19086,<jats:p>A detailed knowledge of the micromagnetic structure of thin films is essential for our understanding of the magnetic processes in modern magnetic materials. Many technological applications in the magnetic-recording industry involve thin-film materials including magnetic and magneto-optic recording media and magneto-resistive sensors. Electron microscopy allows imaging of the magnetic structure of such thin films with very high spatial resolution. It is also possible in certain instruments to study the behavior of the materials in the presence of a magnetic field while the specimen is still in the microscope. This facility offers the prospect of full magnetic characterization of thinned materials using electron microscopy.</jats:p>

<jats:p>Co–Zn nanocrystalline ferrites with chemical composition Co0:5Zn0:5Fe2O4 were synthesized by sol-gel and combustion methods. The sol-gel method was carried out in two ways, i.e. based on chelating agents PVA and PEG of high and low molecular weights. In auto-combustion method, the ratio of citric acid to metal nitrate was taken as 1:1, while in sol-gel method the chelating agents were taken based on oxygen balance. All the three samples were studied by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis for the identification of phase formation and ferritization temperature. The synthesized samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and FT-IR spectroscopy without any thermal treatment. The measured lattice constants and observed characteristic IR absorption bands of the three samples are in good agreement with the reported values showing the formation of a cubic spinel structure. The crystallite sizes of all samples were determined using high intensity peaks and W-H plot. Size-Strain Plot method was also implemented since two of the samples showed low crystallite sizes. The least crystallite size (5.5 nm) was observed for the sample CZVP while the highest (23.8 nm) was observed for the sample CZCA. Cation distribution was proposed based on calculated and observed intensity ratios of selected planes from X ray diffraction data. All structural parameters were presented using experimental lattice constant and oxygen positional parameter, and they correlated with FT-IR results. Magnetic measurements were carried out using vibrating sample magnetometer at room temperature to obtain the characteristic parameters such as saturation magnetization, coercivity, remanence, squareness ratio and Bohr magnetons. Among all, the sample synthesized via citric acid autocombustion method displayed a remarkably higher magnetization of 53 emu/g and the remaining two samples displayed low magnetization values owing to their smaller crystallite sizes.</jats:p>"
19505,"<jats:p>The nonstoichiometric Ir0.9Mn1−xSn1.1+x (x = 0.1, 0.05, and −0.05) are crystallized in half-Heusler alloys. The magnetic transition is observed at 77 K for x = 1.05, and it decreases with the decreasing Mn content. It is proven to be a ferromagnetic transition with a nonlinear magnetic moment alignment, as the magnetization is not saturated at 70 kOe. The different magnetic behavior than a typical ferromagnet (FM is due to the Ir ions with strong spin orbital coupling (SOC). The different hysteresis loops reflect that the ionic distribution is not completely homogeneous. The high coercivity observed in the cubic compound is due to the strong single-ion anisotropy of the Ir ions. A metallic-semiconducting transition at 130 K is observed in Ir0.9Mn1.05Sn1.05. A negative magnetoresistance is observed at 2 K and 14 T with the value as −2.6%.</jats:p>"
19506,"<jats:p>Samples consisting of one ferromagnetic and one diamagnetic component which are immiscible at the thermodynamic equilibrium (Co-Cu, Fe-Cu, Fe-Ag) are processed by high-pressure torsion at various compositions. The received microstructures are investigated by electron microscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, showing a microstructural saturation. Results gained from microstructural investigations are correlated to magnetometry data. The Co-Cu samples show mainly ferromagnetic behavior and a decrease in coercivity with increasing Co-content. The saturation microstructure of Fe-Cu samples is found to be dual phase. Results of magnetic measurements also revealed the occurrence of two different magnetic phases in this system. For Fe-Ag, the microstructural and magnetic results indicate that no intermixing between the elemental phases takes place.</jats:p>"

19508,"<jats:p>A new composite magnetic photocatalyst, Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4, prepared by a hydrothermal-roasting method was studied. The photocatalytic properties of Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4 were evaluated by degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) under simulated sunlight irradiation, and the structures and properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible light (UV-Vis) diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS), and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results indicated that Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4 was an orthorhombic crystal, which was similar to that observed for Bi5O7I. Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4 consisted of irregularly shaped nanosheets that were 40–60 nm thick. The most probable pore size was 24.1 nm and the specific surface area was 7.07 m2/g. Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4 could absorb both ultraviolet and visible light, and the energy gap value was 3.22 eV. The saturation magnetization, coercivity and residual magnetization of Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4 were 3.9 emu/g, 126.6 Oe, and 0.7 emu/g respectively, which could help Bi5O7I/MnxZn1−xFe2O4 be separated and recycled from wastewater under the action of an external magnetic field. The recycling experiments revealed that the average recovery rate of the photocatalyst was 90.1%, and the photocatalytic activity was still more than 81.1% after five cycles.</jats:p>"

19515,"<jats:p>The soft magnetic properties of Fe-based nanocrystalline alloys are determined by their grain size. In the present article, the (Fe0.4Co0.6)79Nb3B18 nanocrystalline alloys have been successfully prepared by isothermal annealing. The variation of soft magnetic properties as a function of annealing temperature and incubation time is investigated in detail. Two distinct crystallization behaviors were found for the (Fe0.4Co0.6)79Nb3B18 alloys. The initial nanocrystallization products comprise a mixture of α-Fe(Co), Fe2B, and Fe23B6-type crystalline metastable phases, and the final crystallization products are composed of α-Fe(Co), Fe2B, and Fe3B crystalline phases. The grain size decreases first and then increases with the increasing annealing temperature in the range of 764–1151 K, and a fine grain size with mean grain size of 12.7 nm can be achieved for alloys annealed at 880 K. As the annealing temperature increases from 764 K to 1151 K, the saturation magnetization increases first and then decreases without a significant increase of the coercivity. The alloys annealed at 880 K exhibit the optimized soft magnetic properties with high Ms of 145 emu g−1 and low Hc of 0.04 Oe.</jats:p>"
19516,"<jats:p>The present study has a dual aim of supporting magnetic nanoparticles over the nanolayers of LDHs and designing two-dimensional magnetic nano-nets of cobalt ferrite. In this trend, nanoparticles of CoFe2O4 were prepared and supported by Co-Fe LDH through urea hydrolysis. The nanolayered structures of Co-Fe LDH were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, FT-IR spectra, thermal analyses, and transmission electron microscopy. In addition, they indicated that 13.2% CoFe2O4 were supported over Co-Fe LDH. Transformation of the nanolayered structures of Co-Fe LDH to nano-nets was achieved by the catalytic effect of the supported CoFe2O4 nanoparticles through solvent thermal technique. X-ray diffraction patterns and transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the transformation of the supported Co-Fe LDH to nano-nets of cobalt ferrite. In order to indicate the effect of the LDH for designing the nano-nets, nanoparticles of cobalt ferrite were prepared by the same technique without LDH. The magnetic behavior of the nano-nets and the supported Co-Fe LDH were measured and compared with the nanoparticles through vibrating sample magnetometer technique. The magnetic parameters indicated that the prepared nano-nets have ferromagnetic behavior and high coercivity. However, the prepared nanoparticles revealed a superparamagnetic state and low coercivity. The experimental results concluded that the incorporation of nanoparticles with nanowires into nano-net structures has been found to be an efficient way to improve their magnetic properties and prevent their agglomerations. Finally, layered double hydroxides are an important source for constructing magnetic nanolayered structures and nano-nets.</jats:p>"

X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicates that samples calcined at 800 °C for 3 h were a single-cubic phase. The lattice parameter decreased with increasing Cr concentration. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed that the sample powders were nanoparticles. It was confirmed from the room temperature Mössbauer spectra that transition from the ferrimagnetic state to the superparamagnetic state occurred with the doping of chromium. Both the saturation magnetization and the coercivity decreased with the chromium doping. With a higher annealing temperature, the saturation magnetization increased and the coercivity increased initially and then decreased for CoCr0.2Fe1.8O4.</jats:p>"
19520,"<jats:p>The present study envisages the preparation of chromium substituted Nickel ferrite NiCrxFe2−xO4 (x = 0~1.0) powders by a sol-gel auto-combustion method. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) showed that the specimens with x &gt; 0.2 exhibited a single-phase spinel structure, and that more content of Cr within a specimen is favorable for the synthesis of pure Ni-Cr ferrites. The lattice parameter decreased with an increase in the Cr concentration. The sample without calcining exhibited a good crystallinity. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) showed the formation of ferrite powders nano-particles, and that the substitution of Cr weakened the agglomeration between the particles. Mössbauer spectra of NiCrxFe2−xO4 showed two normal Zeeman-split sextets that displayed a ferrimagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the spectra indicated that iron was in the Fe3+ state, and the magnetic hyperfine field at the tetrahedral tended to decrease with an increase in the Cr substitution. The saturation magnetization decreased by the Cr3+ ions, and reached a minimum value (Ms = 4.46 emu/g). With an increase in the annealing temperature, the coercivity increased initially, which later decreased.</jats:p>"
19521,"<jats:p>A sol-gel autocombustion method was used to synthesize Al3+ ion-substituted cobalt ferrite CoAlxFe2−xO4 (x = 0–1.5). According to X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), cobalt ferrite was in a single cubic phase after being calcined at 1000 °C for 3 h. Moreover, the lattice constant decreased with increase in aluminum substituents. When the sample was analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), we found that uniformly sized, well-crystallized grains were distributed in the sample. Furthermore, we confirmed that Al3+ ion-substituted cobalt ferrite underwent a transition from ferrimagnetic to superparamagnetic behavior; the superparamagnetic behavior was completely correlated with the increase in Al3+ ion concentration at room temperature. All these findings were observed in Mössbauer spectra. For the cobalt ferrite CoAlxFe2−xO4, the coercivity and saturation magnetization decrease with an increase in aluminum content. When the annealing temperature of CoAl0.1Fe1.9O4 was steadily increased, the coercivity and saturation magnetization initially increased and then decreased.</jats:p>"

The structural properties and magnetic of the samples were investigated with X-ray diffraction (XRD), superconducting quantum interference device, and a Mössbauer spectrometer. The results of XRD showed that the powder of a single cubic phase of ferrites calcined when kept at 800 °C for 3 h. The lattice constant increases with increase in Zn concentration, but average crystallite size does not decrease constantly by increasing the zinc content, which is related to pH value. It was confirmed that the transition from ferrimagnetic to superparamagnetic behaviour depends on increasing zinc concentration by Mössbauer spectra at room temperature. Magnetization at room temperature increases for x ≤ 0.3, but decreases for increasing Zn2+ ions. The magnetization of Co0.7Zn0.3Fe2O4 reached maximum value (83.51 emu/g). The coercivity decreased with Zn2+ ions, which were doped on account of the decrease of the anisotropy constant.</jats:p>"
19525,"<jats:p>A comparative study of the magnetic properties of the arrays of Co nanowires and nanotubes with large external diameters (180 nm) has been carried out. The nanowires/nanotubes were grown by electrodeposition into the self-assembled pores of anodic alumina membranes. The experimental study of their magnetic behavior was focused on the angular dependence of hysteresis loops and their parameters. In both nanowire and nanotube arrays, from the analysis of experimental data, effective longitudinal magnetic anisotropy is concluded, which is stronger in the case of the nanotube array. In addition, the extremely small remanence observed for all loops indicates the important role played by magnetostatic interactions. Micromagnetic simulations were first performed considering intrinsic shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy terms, together with an effective easy-plane anisotropy to account for those magnetostatic interactions. A qualitative agreement between experiments and simulations is found despite the complexity introduced by the intrinsic and extrinsic array properties (i.e., large diameters, grain structure, and array configuration). In addition, simulations were also carried out for individual nanowire/nanotube with a particular emphasis to understand their differences at the remanence, due to pure geometry contribution.</jats:p>"
19526,"<jats:p>This work reports on the synthesis, with the thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) technique, of poly (l-lactide) (PLLA) scaffolds containing Fe-doped hydroxyapatite (FeHA) particles for bone regeneration. Magnetization curves and X-ray diffraction indicate two magnetic particle phases: FeHA and magnetite Fe3O4. Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are approximately 30 ± 5 nm in width and 125 ± 25 nm in length, and show typical ferromagnetic properties, including coercivity and rapid saturation magnetization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the magnetic scaffolds reveal their complex morphology changes with MNP concentration. Similarly, at compositions of approximately 20% MNPs, the phase separation changes, passing from solid–liquid to liquid–liquid as revealed by the hill-like structures, with low peaks that give the walls in the SEM images a surface pattern of micro-ruggedness typical of nucleation mechanisms and growth. In vitro degradation experiments, carried out for more than 28 weeks, demonstrated that the MNPs delay the scaffold degradation process. Cytotoxicity is appreciated for FeHA content above 20%.</jats:p>"

19528,"<jats:p>In the present work, different synthesis procedures have been demonstrated to fill carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with Fe1-xNix alloy nanoparticles (x = 0.33, 0.5). CNTs act as templates for the encapsulation of magnetic nanoparticles, and provide a protective shield against oxidation as well as prevent nanoparticles agglomeration. By variation of the reaction parameters, the purity of the samples, degree of filling, the composition and size of filling nanoparticles have been tailored and therefore the magnetic properties. The samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Bright-field (BF) TEM tomography, X-ray powder diffraction, superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The Fe1-xNix-filled CNTs show a huge enhancement in the coercive fields compared to the corresponding bulk materials, which make them excellent candidates for several applications such as magnetic storage devices.</jats:p>"

They were initially screened for the structural and morphological properties by X-ray diffraction and field emission scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Vibrational properties of the samples were studied by Raman and infrared spectroscopies. X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of single pure or near-pure phase with cubic spinel structure for all the samples with expected occupancy values. The field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed a decrease in the particle size with an increase in Mg concentration. Both structural and magnetic properties of the samples were characterized using Mössbauer spectroscopy while the magnetic properties were studied using vibrating sample magnetometry. The changes in magnetic moment of ions, their coupling with neighboring ions and cation exchange interactions were confirmed from the Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis. Saturation magnetization and coercivity values can be explained based on the Slater-Pauling curve. The magnetometry results showed a decrease in saturation magnetization of the samples with increase in Mg concentration</jats:p>"

19559,"<jats:p>The article is devoted to the analysis of changes in the magnetic characteristics of ferrites in the CoO-NiO-ZnO system by the simplex method. Ferrites of Ni-Zn, Co-Zn, and Co-Ni were synthesized in the form of nanoparticles (20-40 nm) using a new method for processing contact nonequilibrium low-temperature plasma (CNP). The effect of the mutual influence of the contents of different cations on the saturation magnetization and the coercive field was investigated using the simplex-lattice method. A magnetic investigation using a vibrational magnetometer shows that low magnetization values are observed for Ni-Zn ferrites and high for the entire Co-Zn and Co-Ni ferrite series. EPR spectra show that the value of the resonant field and line width corresponds to the value of magnetic saturation and is due to the arrangement of cations on sublattices.</jats:p>"

19561,"<jats:p>RESUMEN Actualmente las nanopartículas magnéticas a base de óxido de hierro son utilizadas en diversas aplicaciones en las áreas de ciencia y tecnología, principalmente por sus propiedades magnéticas. Asimismo, estos materiales son utilizados en aplicaciones biomédicas tales como en la obtención de imágenes por resonancia magnética, hipertermia magnética, liberación de fármacos, etc. En este trabajo se reporta la síntesis y caracterización de ferritas de Mg y Zn con composición química Mg1-xZnxFe2O4 (x=0-0,9) mediante el método de descomposición térmica (DT). Se utilizaron acetilacetonatos metálicos (Mg, Zn y Fe) como reactivos y ácido oleico/feniléter como medio de reacción. Los materiales obtenidos se caracterizaron utilizando las técnicas de difracción de rayos X (DRX), magnetometría de muestra vibrante (MMV), espectroscopia de infrarrojo por transformada de Fourier (FT-IR) y microscopía electrónica de transmisión (MET). Los patrones de difracción de rayos X de los materiales obtenidos muestran la formación de una única fase cristalina con estructura de espinela inversa correspondiente a una ferrita de magnesio (JCPDS 88-1935). Las propiedades magnéticas, tales como magnetización de saturación (Ms), magnetización remanente (Mr) y campo coercitivo (Hc) de las ferritas Mg-Zn fueron evaluadas mediante MMV. Se encontró que la Ms aumenta a medida que se incrementa el contenido de Zn2+ alcanzando valores de 20,22 a 40,30 emu/g, dicho cambio se atribuye a la variación de la distribución de los cationes presentes en la estructura de espinela. Mediante FT-IR y MET se determinó que las partículas sintetizadas poseen un recubrimiento superficial de ácido oleico, una morfología cercana a la esférica y un tamaño de partícula inferior a los 10 nm. De estos resultados se confirma la viabilidad de la incorporación de iones Zn dentro de la estructura cristalina de MgFe2O4 utilizando el método de DT, obteniéndose ferritas potencialmente utilizables en aéreas biomédicas.</jats:p>"

The diffusivity and diffusion depth of Dy were increased in those magnets which were treated with Cu or Al mixed DyCo, mainly due to comparatively easy diffusion path provided by Cu and Al because of their solubility with Ndrich grain boundary phase. The formation of Cu/Al-rich grain boundary phase might have enhanced the diffusivity of Dy-atoms.

This behaviour vanishes in magnets with a high degree of misorientation.

During the HDDR process, desorption-recombination (DR) reaction was induced at two different temperature, 810°C and 820°C. The higher Nd content resulted in enhanced coercivity of the HDDR powder, and which was attributed to the thicker and more uniform Nd-rich phase along grain boundaries. But this uniform Nd-rich phase induced faster grain growth. The remanence of the powder DR-treated at 820°C is higher than that DR-treated at 810°C. In addition, it was also confirmed that higher DR temperature is much more effective to improve squareness.</jats:p>"

This was achieved by pre-polymerizing the organic phase, which contained co-monomers, porogens and treated magnetic particles, at 65°C for 0.5 h under ultrasound conditions. Aqueous solutions containing a dispersion agent were then added to effect suspension polymerization. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and magnetic property measurement system (MPMS) were used to characterize the functional magnetic porous microspheres. The results show that the microparticles are well shaped with a uniform size distribution of about 0.5 ∼ 0.7 mm and the surfaces of the microspheres have many micro-pores with an average diameter of 0.533 µm. There are carboxyl groups (−COOH) on the surface of the microspheres to the extent of 0.65 mmol g−1, as determined by conductometric titration. According to the XRD spectra, iron oxide consists mainly of SrFe12O19 which reveals hexahedral structure. The content of magnetic SrFe12O19 reaches 17.81% (by mass), and the microspheres have good heat resistance. The magnetic porous microspheres are ferromagnetic with high residual magnetization and coercivity, 21.59 emu g−1 and 4.13 kOe, respectively. The saturation magnetisation is around 42.85 emu g−1.</jats:p>"

XRD, FTIR, and SEM were used for structure, composition, and morphology investigation. A porous network structure was observed with average particle size 60–67 nm. All samples had a cubic spinel structure. The unit cell parameter “a” decreases linearly with nickel concentration due to the smaller ionic radius of nickel.

19826,"<jats:p>It is well known that FePd alloys are effective as a magneto-thermoelastic actuator material,
because they have large magnetostriction and shape memory effect. In order to use the alloys for a
micro-actuator, magnetic properties and microstructures have been examined as for rapidly solidified
Fe-29.6 at% Pd alloy ribbons. The ribbons exhibit a large magnetostriction at room temperature and
good shape memory effect. Magnetostriction and coercive force of the ribbons markedly depend on
the direction of the applied magnetic field. Maximum values of magnetostriction and coercive force
are obtained at θ = 85 degree (θ is the angle between the magnetic field and the ribbon plane). Relief
effects corresponding to the formation of FCT martensite variants are observed on the grains. X-ray
diffraction profile at room temperature shows that FCT martensitic phase and FCC parent phase
coexist in the ribbon. Dense striations are observed in the TEM bright field images of FCT martensite
plates. Selected area electron diffraction patterns revealed the striations to be thin twins.</jats:p>"

Here, we report an unusual intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in the antiferromagnetic Heusler Weyl semimetal compounds GdPtBi and NdPtBi that is observed over a wide temperature range. In particular, GdPtBi exhibits an anomalous Hall conductivity of up to 60 Ω<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>⋅cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and an anomalous Hall angle as large as 23%.

20094,"<jats:p>Germanium telluride (GeTe)-based materials, which display intriguing functionalities, have been intensively studied from both fundamental and technological perspectives. As a thermoelectric material, though, the phase transition in GeTe from a rhombohedral structure to a cubic structure at ∼700 K is a major obstacle impeding applications for energy harvesting. In this work, we discovered that the phase-transition temperature can be suppressed to below 300 K by a simple Bi and Mn codoping, resulting in the high performance of cubic GeTe from 300 to 773 K. Bi doping on the Ge site was found to reduce the hole concentration and thus to enhance the thermoelectric properties. Mn alloying on the Ge site simultaneously increased the hole effective mass and the Seebeck coefficient through modification of the valence bands. With the Bi and Mn codoping, the lattice thermal conductivity was also largely reduced due to the strong point-defect scattering for phonons, resulting in a peak thermoelectric figure of merit (<jats:italic>ZT</jats:italic>) of ∼1.5 at 773 K and an average <jats:italic>ZT</jats:italic> of ∼1.1 from 300 to 773 K in cubic Ge<jats:sub>0.81</jats:sub>Mn<jats:sub>0.15</jats:sub>Bi<jats:sub>0.04</jats:sub>Te.

20231,"<jats:p>In this paper, a micrometre thin film of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is characterized for thermoelectric properties. The sample was prepared through mechanical exfoliation of a molybdenite crystal. The Seebeck coefficient measurement was performed by generating a temperature gradient across the sample and recording the induced electrical voltage, and for this purpose a simple measurement setup was developed. In the measurement, platinum was utilized as reference material in the electrodes. The Seebeck value of MoS2 was estimated to be approximately −600 µV/K at a temperature difference of 40 °C. The negative sign indicates that the polarity of the material is n-type. For measurement of the thermal conductivity, the sample was sandwiched between the heat source and the heat sink, and a steady-state power of 1.42 W was provided while monitoring the temperature difference across the sample. Based on Fourier’s law of conduction, the thermal conductivity of the sample was estimated to be approximately 0.26 Wm-1 K-1. The electrical resistivity was estimated to be 29 Ω cm. The figure of merit of MoS2 was estimated to be 1.99 × 10-4.</jats:p>"

Their integration into electricity markets is made by minimizing grid-connection costs, thus improving energy-availability and economic-efficiency levels. In this context, this work analyzes the sizing-investment adequacy of a 100 MWe parabolic-trough solar-thermal power plant regarding solar resources and thermal energy into power-block availability for both regulated and deregulated electricity markets. For this proposal, the design of a mathematical model for the optimal operation of parabolic-trough power plants with thermal storage by two tanks of molten salt is described. Model calibration is made by using a currently operated plant. Solar-resource availability is studied in three different radiation scenarios. The levelized cost of electricity and production profit relating to the investment cost are used to analyze plant sustainability. Thus, the levelized cost of electricity shows the best plant configuration for each radiation scenario within a regulated market. For deregulated markets, the optimal plant configuration tends to enhance the solar multiple and thermal-storage capacity thanks to an increment on selling profit. The gross average annual benefit for electricity generation of deregulated against regulated markets exceeds 21% in all radiation areas under study.</jats:p>"

20247,"<jats:p>The review embraces a number of research papers concerning the fabrication of oxide thermoelectric systems, with TiO2−SrTiO3 biphase ceramics being emphasized. The ceramics is particularly known for a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) forming spontaneously on the TiO2/SrTiO3 heterointerface (modulation doping), unlike ordinary 2DEG occurrence on specially fabricated thin film. Such effect is provided by the SrTiO3 conduction band edge being 0.40 and 0.20 eV higher than that for anatase and rutile TiO2, respectively. That is why, in the case of a checkered arrangement of TiO2 and SrTiO3 grains, the united 2D net is probably formed along the grain boundaries with 2DEG occurring there. To reach such conditions, there should be applied novelties in the field of ceramics materials science, because it is important to obtain highly dense material preserving small (nanoscale) grain size and thin interface boundary. The review also discusses some aspects of reactive spark plasma sintering as a promising method of preparing perovskite-oxide TiO2−SrTiO3 thermoelectric materials for high-temperature applications.</jats:p>"

The Cu–Te powder was incorporated into the Cu2SnSe3 powder by the ball milling process and the Cu–Te/Cu2SnSe3 thermoelectric composite was prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS). With the amount of Cu–Te powder increasing, the carrier concentration of the Cu–Te/Cu2SnSe3 composite increased, while the carrier mobility and electrical conductivity initially increased and then decreased. Compared to the Seebeck coefficient of the Cu2SnSe3 matrix, the Seebeck coefficient of the Cu–Te/Cu2SnSe3 samples increased slightly. Moreover, the Cu–Te/Cu2SnSe3 composites had lower thermal conductivity and lattice thermal conductivity over the whole temperature range. The lattice thermal conductivity of the 0.8 vol.% Cu–Te/Cu2SnSe3 composite achieved the lowest value of 0.22 W/m·K, which was 78% lower than that of the Cu2SnSe3 matrix.

Several samples (x = 0.50–0.90 and y = 0.15–0.48) were prepared by melting-sintering, and two of them were densified by spark plasma sintering in order to study their thermoelectric features. The crystallographic study enables the recognition of the role of the filler size in ruling the filling fraction and the compositional location of the p/n crossover: It has been found that the former lowers and the latter moves toward lower x values with the reduction of the filler ionic size, as a consequence of the progressively weaker interaction of the filler with the Sb12 cavity. The analysis of thermoelectric properties indicates that, despite the Sm3+/Gd3+ small mass difference, the contemporary presence of these ions in the 2a site significantly affects the thermal conductivity of both p- and n-compositions. This occurs by reducing its value with respect to the Sm-filled compound at each temperature considered, and making the overall thermoelectric performance of the system comparable to several multi-filled (Fe, Ni)-based skutterudites described in the literature.</jats:p>"

Here, we report that the Seebeck coefficient of CTSe can be controlled by adding SnS within a CTSe matrix. CTSe-SnS composite has not only high Seebeck coefficient in the range of 300–500 µVolt/K but thermal conductivity which is lower than that of pristine CTSe due to the scattering at the interface between the matrix and the SnS particles.

An increase in the Seebeck coefficient of more than 100 μV/K, almost doubling the expected value, is noticed around a temperature of 260 °C. As pointed out by thermal analyses, this is due to a second order transition of kesterite from an ordered I-4 to a disordered I-42m crystal structure. Conversely to what happens for solar cell materials, where the transition is considered to be detrimental for the performance, it appears to be beneficial for the thermoelectric Seebeck coefficient, suggesting that higher crystal symmetry and cation-disorder due to the transition lead to thermopower enhancement.</jats:p>"

Based on density-functional theory and Boltzmann transport equation, we systematically research the TE properties of M2C3. Results indicate that the Bi2C3 possesses low phonon group velocity (~2.07 km/s), low optical modes (~2.12 THz), large Grüneisen parameters (~4.46), and short phonon relaxation time. Based on these intrinsic properties, heat transport ability will be immensely restrained and therefore lead to a low thermal conductivity (~4.31 W/mK) for the Bi2C3 at 300 K. A twofold degeneracy is observed at conduction bands along Γ-M direction, which gives a high n-type electrical conductivity. Its low thermal conductivity and high Seebeck coefficient lead to an excellent TE response. The maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of n-type can approach 1.41 for Bi2C3.

While the solid solution of Yb14Mn1-xZnxSb11 shows an improvement in the high temperature figure of merit of about 10% over Yb14MnSb11, there has been no investigation of optimization of the Zn containing phase. In an effort to expand the possible high temperature p-type thermoelectric materials with this structure type, the rare earth (RE) containing solid solution Yb14-xRExZnSb11 (RE = Y, La) was investigated. The substitution of a small amount of 3+ rare earth (RE) for Yb2+ was employed as a means of optimizing Yb14MnSb11 for use as a thermoelectric material. Yb14ZnSb11 is considered an intermediate valence Kondo system where some percentage of the Yb is formally 3+ and undergoes a reduction to 2+ at ~85 K. The substitution of a 3+ RE element could either replace the Yb3+ or add to the total amount of 3+ RE and provides changes to the electronic states. RE = Y, La were chosen as they represent the two extremes in size as substitutions for Yb: a similar and much larger size RE, respectively, compared with Yb3+. The composition x = 0.5 was chosen as that is the typical amount of RE element that can be substituted into Yb14MnSb11. These two new RE containing compositions show a significant improvement in Seebeck while decreasing thermal conductivity. The addition of RE increases the melting point of Yb14ZnSb11 so that the transport data from 300 K to 1275 K can be collected. The figure of merit is increased five times over that of Yb14ZnSb11 and provides a zT ~0.7 at 1275 K.</jats:p>"

Second, the as-deposited film is reactively annealed under O2 gas flow to form the final phase of CaxCoO2.

Our composition analyses show that only a small amount of Cu is determined in the clathrates. The single crystal X-ray diffraction data refinements confirm that Ga atoms prefer the 6c and 24k sites and avoid the 16i sites in the crystal structure. The small amount of Cu affects the crystal structure by compressing the tetrakaidecahedral cage along the direction perpendicular to the six-atom-ring plane.

Among thermoelectric materials (TE), PbTe-PbSe-PbS quaternary alloys and composites are promising candidates for thermoelectric power generation applications in the mid-temperature operating range from 500 to ~850 K. Besides, the thermoelectric performance of quaternary alloys and composites is not fully optimized regarding its composition and synthesis process. In the quaternary system, PbTe-PbSe-PbS, it was found that PbS will form nanoprecipitation in the matrix of quaternary alloy for a small content of PbS (≤0.07), which reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. The power factor of PbTe-PbSe-PbS quaternary alloys can be significantly enhanced by using a band convergence in PbTe1−xSex. The band structure modifications, with the result of simultaneous PbS nanoprecipitation, give rise to a high     Z T     value of 2.3 at 800 K for (PbTe)0.95−x(PbSe)x(PbS)0.05. The chemical potential tuning by effective K-doping (   x    = 0.02) and PbS substitution reveals a high power factor and low thermal conductivity, resulting in a comparatively high     Z T     value of 1.72 at 800 K.

In order to expand the possibilities for conducting thermodynamic assessments of the efficiency of various thermal power plants, a new criterion of efficiency Ku is proposed as a coefficient that takes into account in a comparable form all types of energy spent on the implementation of the cycle. In determining the criterion Ku, useful effect obtained from the implementation of a direct circular process is considered to be the specific work of the expansion of the working fluid in the cycle. Such work, in particular, can be the work of steam expansion in the turbine. The total energy cost is the sum of the specific heat supplied to the working body in a circular process and the specific mechanical work spent in the cycle on compression and pressure increase of the working body. In particular, the work is taken into account in a comparable form-taking into account the heat that was spent on its production. The analysis of the Ku criterion is carried out. As a result of the analysis we have established that at transition from the general physical model of reception of specific work of expansion in direct circular process for which Ku criterion can be applied, to the special case assuming a number of assumptions, Ku criterion can become equal to thermal coefficient useful action of a cycle.

Some conclusions were drawn: (1) the output power characteristic curve of the coupling transformer was acquired; (2) given a constant line current, the maximum power was achieved when the system’s capacitive reactance and the internal resistance of the transformer matched, and the maximum power was unrelated to the number of turns of the coupling transformer; (3) the output power changed with the variation of the line current, and there was a proportional relationship between the maximum power and the square of the line current.

The existing design processes for the heat-pipe cooling system guarantee that the junction temperature of power devices does not exceed the maximum allowable junction temperature when the railway propulsion inverter operates under its mission profile; therefore, each step of the design process was reviewed to analyze the effect of the heat-pipe cooling system. Based on the processes, in the calculation for the required thermal resistance of the heat-pipe cooling system, two difference losses were considered with the thermal resistances of the insulated gate bipolar mode transistor (IGBT) module and the thermal grease at an interface between the baseplate of IGBT module and heat-pipe cooling system. The control scheme and mission profile of the train were taken into account to calculate the power losses. Then, the designed heat-pipe cooling systems were compared in terms of the size and weight. In addition, the junction temperatures and lifetimes of the power module with heat-pipe cooling systems designed by different power losses were estimated and compared.

This study investigates and compares the thermodynamic performance of the OTC, SFC, and SDC based on the waste heat source from the cement kiln with an initial temperature of 320 °C and mass flow rate of 86.2 kg/s. The effects of the main parameters on the cycle performance are analyzed and the parameter optimization is performed with net power output as the objective function. Results indicate that the maximum net power output of SDC is slightly higher than that of SFC and the OTC using n-pentane provides a 19.74% increase in net power output over the SDC since it can achieve the higher use of waste heat and higher turbine efficiency. However, the turbine inlet temperature of the OTC is limited by the thermal stability of the organic working fluid, hence the SDC outputs more power than that of the OTC when the initial temperature of the exhaust gas exceeds 415 °C.</jats:p>"

20503,"<jats:p>Identification of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) radionuclide dispersion conditions, which are characterized by ABL dispersion parameters, plays an important role in evaluating the radiation safety of nuclear power plants (NPPs) and establishing engineering protection thereof. Therefore, the ABL status monitoring observations are launched at the stage of in-situ NPP construction. When analyzing and predicting radiation situation in the NPP vicinity areas, it is of great importance to determine the parameters of atmospheric dispersion variability with time. The ABL status monitoring at the Belorussian NPP site has been carried out since September 2014 by means of acoustic and radio-acoustic sounding of the ABL. The present study is aimed at assessing interannual and intra-annual variability of atmospheric dispersion parameters in the Belorussian NPP siting area on the basis of the monitoring data. The relative interannual stability of the main average annual atmospheric dispersion characteristics (vertical temperature gradient, wind speed and direction) over the observation period has been revealed. At the same time, the average seasonal values of the dispersion parameters are characterized by significant fluctuations thereof during the annual course.

20504,"<jats:p>Stochastically fluctuating wind power has an escalating impact on the stability of power grid operations. To smooth out short- and long-term fluctuations, this paper presents a coordinated control algorithm using model predictive control (MPC) to manage a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of ultra-capacitor (UC) and lithium-ion battery (LB) banks. In the HESS-computing period, the algorithm minimizes HESS operating costs in the subsequent prediction horizon by optimizing the time constant of a flexible first-delay filter (FDF) to obtain the UC power output. In the LB-computing period, the algorithm keeps the optimal time constant of the FDF from the previous period to directly obtain the power output of the UC bank to minimize the power output of the LB bank in the next prediction horizon. A relaxation technique is deployed when the problem is unsolvable. Thus, the fluctuation mitigation requirements are fulfilled with a large probability even in extreme conditions. A state-of-charge (SOC) feedback control strategy is proposed to regulate the SOC of the HESS within its proper range. Case studies and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that the proposed MPC-based algorithm uses a lower power rating and storage capacity than other conventional algorithms to satisfy one-minute and 30-min fluctuation mitigation requirements (FMR).</jats:p>"

In this study, a new ultra-low-power hybrid energy harvesting (HEH) system for two types of microenergy collection (photovoltaic (PV) and soil-temperature-difference thermoelectric (TE)) was designed to provide stable power to WSNs. The power supply capabilities of two microenergy sources were assessed by analyzing the electrical characteristics and performing continuous energy data collection. The HEH system consisted of two separated power converters and an electronic multiplexer circuit to avoid impedance mismatch and improve efficiency. The feasibility of the self-powered HEH system was verified by consumption analysis of the HEH system, the WSNs, and the data analysis of the collected microenergy. Taking the summation of PV and TEG input power of 1.26 mW (PPV:PTEG was about 3:1) as an example, the power loss of the HEH system accounted for 33.8% of the total input power.

These compounds share the same structural type, i.e. bilayers of donors, which are packed in a β″-type pattern and then separated by layers of highly disordered anions. The absolute values of the electrical resistivity measured in single crystals within the layers were found in the range of 5 to 18 (Ωcm)−1, with a significantly sample dependence being ascribed to intrinsic disorder effects. The ClO4− and SbF6− salts exhibit metallic behavior with the resistivity decreasing upon cooling almost linearly with temperature until a broad minimum is reached between 15 and 80 K, depending on crystal quality; this is followed by an upturn of resistivity reaching values at T = 1.5 K that were comparable to those attained at room temperature. The electrical resistivity of the ReO4− salt follows a thermally activated behavior already at T = 300 K, although with a small activation energy in the range 16−18 meV. Thermoelectric power measurements yield large positive values (75–80 µV/K) at ambient temperature with a metallic behavior that is identical for all compounds. Temperature and polarization dependent infrared reflection measurements on single crystals of (CNB-EDT-TTF)4X salts, with X = ClO4−, ReO4−, and SbF6−, have been performed to obtain the optical conductivity and analyze the electronic and vibrational properties. For (CNB-EDT-TTF)4ClO4 the molecular vibrations exhibit a significant variation below T = 23 K, which suggests a charge localization phenomena.</jats:p>"

Among thermoelectric materials (TE), PbTe-PbSe-PbS quaternary alloys and composites are promising candidates for thermoelectric power generation applications in the mid-temperature operating range from 500 to ~850 K. Besides, the thermoelectric performance of quaternary alloys and composites is not fully optimized regarding its composition and synthesis process. In the quaternary system, PbTe-PbSe-PbS, it was found that PbS will form nanoprecipitation in the matrix of quaternary alloy for a small content of PbS (≤0.07), which reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. The power factor of PbTe-PbSe-PbS quaternary alloys can be significantly enhanced by using a band convergence in PbTe1−xSex. The band structure modifications, with the result of simultaneous PbS nanoprecipitation, give rise to a high     Z T     value of 2.3 at 800 K for (PbTe)0.95−x(PbSe)x(PbS)0.05. The chemical potential tuning by effective K-doping (   x    = 0.02) and PbS substitution reveals a high power factor and low thermal conductivity, resulting in a comparatively high     Z T     value of 1.72 at 800 K.

Besides, the thermoelectric performance of quaternary alloys and composites is not fully optimized regarding its composition and synthesis process. In the quaternary system, PbTe-PbSe-PbS, it was found that PbS will form nanoprecipitation in the matrix of quaternary alloy for a small content of PbS (≤0.07), which reduces the lattice thermal conductivity. The power factor of PbTe-PbSe-PbS quaternary alloys can be significantly enhanced by using a band convergence in PbTe1−xSex. The band structure modifications, with the result of simultaneous PbS nanoprecipitation, give rise to a high     Z T     value of 2.3 at 800 K for (PbTe)0.95−x(PbSe)x(PbS)0.05.

The existing design processes for the heat-pipe cooling system guarantee that the junction temperature of power devices does not exceed the maximum allowable junction temperature when the railway propulsion inverter operates under its mission profile; therefore, each step of the design process was reviewed to analyze the effect of the heat-pipe cooling system. Based on the processes, in the calculation for the required thermal resistance of the heat-pipe cooling system, two difference losses were considered with the thermal resistances of the insulated gate bipolar mode transistor (IGBT) module and the thermal grease at an interface between the baseplate of IGBT module and heat-pipe cooling system. The control scheme and mission profile of the train were taken into account to calculate the power losses. Then, the designed heat-pipe cooling systems were compared in terms of the size and weight. In addition, the junction temperatures and lifetimes of the power module with heat-pipe cooling systems designed by different power losses were estimated and compared.

Results indicate that the maximum net power output of SDC is slightly higher than that of SFC and the OTC using n-pentane provides a 19.74% increase in net power output over the SDC since it can achieve the higher use of waste heat and higher turbine efficiency.

To smooth out short- and long-term fluctuations, this paper presents a coordinated control algorithm using model predictive control (MPC) to manage a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of ultra-capacitor (UC) and lithium-ion battery (LB) banks. In the HESS-computing period, the algorithm minimizes HESS operating costs in the subsequent prediction horizon by optimizing the time constant of a flexible first-delay filter (FDF) to obtain the UC power output. In the LB-computing period, the algorithm keeps the optimal time constant of the FDF from the previous period to directly obtain the power output of the UC bank to minimize the power output of the LB bank in the next prediction horizon. A relaxation technique is deployed when the problem is unsolvable. Thus, the fluctuation mitigation requirements are fulfilled with a large probability even in extreme conditions. A state-of-charge (SOC) feedback control strategy is proposed to regulate the SOC of the HESS within its proper range. Case studies and quantitative comparisons demonstrate that the proposed MPC-based algorithm uses a lower power rating and storage capacity than other conventional algorithms to satisfy one-minute and 30-min fluctuation mitigation requirements (FMR).</jats:p>"

To investigate the heat dissipation system, the cabinet operating temperature, circulating oil system temperature and cabinet exhaust temperature, cabinet heat density, oil flow rates and fan power were analyzed. It was found that the average cooling efficiency of the liquid-cooled cabinet increased by 66% compared with the average cooling efficiency of the conventional air-cooled cabinet. The operating temperature in air-cooled cabinets is as high as 55 °C, and the operating temperature in liquid-cooled cabinets does not exceed 50 °C.

In this paper, we present the impact of synthesis parameters on thermoelectric properties of nanocarbon material. We conducted a number of syntheses of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) at different temperatures (800 and 900 °C) using various amounts of catalyst (2%, 5.5%, and 9.6%) to facilitate the process. We also tested the influence of injection rate of precursor and the necessity of material purification on thermoelectric properties of MWCNTs. The electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient were measurement for all samples. Based on these parameters, the values of Power Factor and Figure of Merit were calculated. The results show that the most important parameter in the context of thermoelectric properties is purity of employed MWCNTs. To obtain appropriate material for this purpose optimum synthesis temperature and appropriate content of the catalyst must be selected. The study also reveals that post-synthetic purification of nanocarbon is essential to produce an attractive material for thermoelectrics.</jats:p>"

Here, we study the thermoelectric response of a series of five anhydrous 1-methyl-3- alkylimidazolium halide ionic liquids with varied chain length and counterion in a high-aspect-ratio, horizontal-temperature-gradient geometry, where convection is minimal. While a canonical constant-volume thermodynamic model predicts that the longer aliphatic groups exhibit larger Seebeck coefficients, we instead measure the opposite: Longer aliphatic chains correlate with lower densities and greater heat expansion, stronger intermolecular associations, stronger steric repulsion, and lower Seebeck coefficients. As evidence of the critical role of thermal expansion, we measure that the Seebeck effect is nonlinear: Values of −2.8 mV/K with a 10 K temperature difference and −1.8 mV/K with a 50 K difference are measured with ether ion. Our results indicate that steric repulsion and heat expansion are important considerations in ionic liquid design; with large temperature differences, the Seebeck coefficient correlates negatively with heat expansion. Our results suggest that Seebeck values will improve if thermal expansion is limited in a pressurized, isochoric, convection-free design.</jats:p>"

With a high percentage of the hawkers involve with cooking activities using the LPG gas stove, excess heat is one of the potential energy which can be converted into electrical energy using a thermoelectric generator (TEG). The aim of this study is to convert the excess heat available used to powered night market electrical facilities. A set of experiments was conducted utilizing five units of TEG connected in series to convert excess heat from a butane gas stove to electrical power. The temperature at both the hot and cold sides of the TEG was recorded used to analyze the effect of power produced. Two electrical parameters namely voltage and current outputs were measured used to calculate the electrical power generated. The analysis focused on the two main governing parameters namely temperature different and Seebeck coefficient toward power generated. It was found that only some amount of excess heat was converted which produced up to 46.8 mW electrical power. This is based on the high temperature recorded at the cold side of the TEG. The almost constant trend showed in temperature different was contributed to a small magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient and so for the power generated. The trend showed by the power generated was also almost constant even the temperature on the hot side keep increasing.

Crosslinking additives are utilized to improve the reliability of PEDOT:PSS film through enhancing hydrophobicity; among these, polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a widely-used additive. However, ether groups in PEG induce water molecules in the film through the hydrogen bond, which deteriorates the TE reliability. Here, we enhance the TE reliability of the PEDOT:PSS film using glycerol as an additive through the crosslinking reaction between the hydroxyl group in glycerol and the sulfonic acid in PEDOT:PSS. The TE reliability (1/Power factor (PF)) of PEG solution-treated PEDOT:PSS film (PEG solution-treated film) was 57% of its initial absolute value (0 h), after 288 h (two weeks) in a humid environment (95% relative humidity, 27 °C temperature). On the other hand, the glycerol solution-treated PEDOT:PSS film (glycerol solution-treated film) exhibited superior TE reliability and preserved 75% of its initial 1/PF. Furthermore, glycerol vapor treatment enabled the film to have stronger TE humid reliability, maintaining 82% of its initial 1/PF, with the same condition. This enhancement is attributed to the increased hydrophobicity and lower oxygen content of the glycerol vapor-treated PEDOT:PSS film (glycerol vapor-treated film), which provides little change in the chemical composition of PEDOT:PSS.</jats:p>"

The thermal conductivity was evaluated by solving the BTE with harmonic and third-order interatomic force constants. The thermal conductivity of CuGaS2 increases with pressure, which is a common behavior. Striking differences occur for the other three compounds. CuInTe2 and AgInTe2 exhibit a drop in the thermal conductivity upon increasing pressure, which is anomalous. AgInTe2 reaches a very low thermal conductivity of 0.2 W·m−1·K−1 at 2.6 GPa, being beneficial for many energy devices, such as thermoelectrics. CuInS2 is an intermediate case. Based on the phonon dispersion data, the phonon frequencies of the acoustic modes for CuInTe2 and AgInTe2 decrease with increasing pressure, thereby driving the anomaly, while there is no significant pressure effect for CuGaS2. This leads to the negative Grüneisen parameter for CuInTe2 and AgInTe2, a decreased phonon relaxation time, and a decreased thermal conductivity. This softening of the acoustic modes upon compression is suggested to be due to a rotational motion of the chalcopyrite building blocks rather than a compressive oscillation. The negative Grüneisen parameters and the anomalous phonon behavior yield a negative thermal expansion coefficient at lower temperatures, based on the Grüneisen vibrational theory.</jats:p>"

21087,"<jats:p>For an efficient energy harvesting by the PV/thermoelectric system, the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) principle is targeted, aiming to operate the system close to peak power point. Under a uniform distribution of the solar irradiance, there is only one maximum power point (MPP), which easily can be efficiently determined by any traditional MPPT method, such as the incremental conductance (INC). A different situation will occur for the non-uniform distribution of solar irradiance, where more than one MPP will exist on the power versus voltage plot of the PV/thermoelectric system. The determination of the global MPP cannot be achieved by conventional methods. To deal with this issue the application of soft computing techniques based on optimization algorithms is used. However, MPPT based on optimization algorithms is very tedious and time consuming, especially under normal conditions. To solve this dilemma, this research examines a hybrid MPPT method, consisting of an incremental conductance (INC) approach and a moth-flame optimizer (MFO), referred to as (INC-MFO) procedure, to reach high adaptability at different environmental conditions. In this way, the combination of the two different algorithms facilitates the utilization of the advantages of the two methods, thereby resulting in a faster speed tracking with uniform radiation distribution and a high accuracy in the case of a non-uniform distribution. It is very important to mention that the INC method is used to track the maximum power point under normal conditions, whereas the MFO optimizer is most relevant for the global search under partial shading. The obtained results revealed that the proposed strategy performed best in both of the dynamic and the steady-state conditions at uniform and non-uniform radiation.</jats:p>"

<jats:p>Au/Pt thermocouples are considered as an alternative to High Temperature Platinum Resistance Thermometers and are one of the prime candidates to replace them as the interpolating instrument of the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) in the temperature range between about 660 °C and 962 °C. This work presents the results of investigation of two Au/Pt thermocouples that used exclusively quartz glass (SiO2) as insulation material. Measurements in fixed points of Zn, Al, and Ag were realized on these thermocouples as well with interchanged inner insulation made of high purity aluminium oxide (Al2O3). The conducted experiments tested the performance of Au/Pt thermocouples with the use of different insulation materials. The measured electromotive forces were found to be sensitive to the replacement of the quartz glass by aluminium oxide as an insulation material of the Au/Pt thermocouples. This change of insulation has resulted in a temperature increase up to about 0.5 K measured at the freezing point of silver. The decreasing insulation resistance of quartz glass at higher temperatures is believed to be the source of thermoelectric instability.</jats:p>"

In this work, we synthesize a conjugated copolymer, namely, BNIDT-DPP, based on a B←N embedded unit, BNIDT, and a typical electron-deficient unit, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP). For comparison, the C–C counterpart, i.e., IDT-DPP, is also synthesized. In contrast to IDT-DPP, the B←N embedded polymer BNIDT-DPP shows an extended absorption edge (836 versus 978 nm), narrowed optical bandgap (1.48 versus 1.27 eV), and higher electron affinity (3.54 versus 3.74 eV). The Gaussian simulations reveal that the B←N embedded polymer BNIDT-DPP is more electron-deficient in contrast to IDT-DPP, supporting the decreased bandgap and energy levels of BNIDT-DPP. Organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) tests indicate a well-defined p-type characteristic for both IDT-DPP and BNIDT-DPP. The hole mobilities of IDT-DPP and BNIDT-DPP tested by OTFTs are 0.059 and 0.035 cm2/V·s, respectively.

It can meet the complementary needs of various energy sources such as cold, thermal, and electricity in industrial parks; can realize multi-energy complements and centralized energy supplies; and can further improve the use efficiency of energy. However, with the extensive access of renewable energy, the uncertainty and intermittentness of renewable energy power generation will greatly reduce the use efficiency of renewable energy and the supply flexibility of IES so as to increase the operational risk of the system operator. With the goal of minimum sum of the system-operating cost and the carbon-emission penalty cost, this paper analyzes the combined supply of cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) influence on system efficiency, compared with the traditional IES. The flexible modified IES realizes the decoupling of cooling, thermal, and electricity; enhances the flexibility of the IES in a variety of energy supply; at the same time, improves the use efficiency of multi-energy; and reasonably avoids the occurrence of energy loss and resource waste. With the aim of reducing the risk that the access of renewable energy may bring to the IES, this paper introduces the fuzzy c-mean-clustering comprehensive quality (FCM-CCQ) algorithm, which is a novel method superior to the general clustering method and performs cluster analysis on the output scenarios of wind power and photovoltaic. Meanwhile, conditional value at risk (CVaR) theory is added to control the system operation risk, which is rarely applied in the field of IES optimization. The model is simulated in a numerical example, and the results demonstrate that the availability and applicability of the presented model are verified. In addition, the carbon dioxide emission of the traditional operation mode; thermoelectric decoupling operation mode; and cooling, thermal, and electricity decoupling operation mode of the IES decrease successively. The system flexibility is greatly enhanced, and the energy-use rate of the system is improved as a whole.

Fifteen (15) healthy male volunteers were recruited to sleep under these test conditions and their sleep quality was assessed by studying objective measures such as sleep onset latency (SOL), mean skin temperature and heart rate as well as subjective parameters like predicted mean vote (PMV) and predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD). There was a consistent improvement on all studied parameters when the power of the system was increased from 240 W to 720 W. The mean sleep onset latency time was reduced from (M = 40.7 +/− 0.98 min) to (M = 18.33 +/− 1.18 min) when the operating power was increased from 240 W to 720 W, denoting an improvement in sleep quality. However, increasing the power further to 840 W resulted in deteriorating cooling performance of the TE-AD system leading to an increase in temperature of the test room and reduction in sleep comfort. Analysis of subjective indices of thermal comfort viz. PMV and PPD revealed that subjects are highly sensitive towards variations in microclimate achieved by changing the operating power of the TE-AD.

The first is to investigate whether it is appropriate to use a planar thick-film thermoelectric sensor to monitor the temperature difference in a processor heat sink. The second is to compare the efficiency of two heat sink models. The third is to compare two kinds of sensors, differing in length. The model of the CPU heat sink sensor system was designed for numerical simulations. The relations between the CPU, heat sink, and the thermoelectric sensor were modelled because they are important for increasing the efficiency of fast processors without interfering with their internal structure. The heat sink was mounted on the top of the thermal model of a CPU (9.6 W). The plate fin and pin fin heat sinks were investigated. Two planar thermoelectric sensors were mounted parallel to the heat sink fins. These sensors monitored changes in the temperature difference between the CPU and the upper surface of the heat sink. The system was equipped with a cooling fan. Switching on the fan changed the thermal conditions (free or forced convection). The simulation results showed the temperature gradient appearing along the sensor for different heat sinks and under different thermal conditions.

This study presents a novel approach to improve short-term hourly photovoltaic power output predictions using feature engineering and machine learning. Feature selection measured the importance score of input features by using a model-based variable importance. It verified that the normative sky index in the weather forecasted data had the least importance as a predictor for hourly prediction of photovoltaic power output. Six different machine-learning algorithms were assessed to select an appropriate model for the hourly power output prediction with onsite weather forecast data. The recurrent neural network outperformed five other models, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, classification and regression trees, chi-square automatic interaction detection, and random forests, in terms of its ability to predict photovoltaic power output at an hourly and daily resolution for 64 tested days. Feature engineering was then used to apply dropout observation to the normative sky index from the training and prediction process, which improved the hourly prediction performance. In particular, the prediction accuracy for overcast days improved by 20% compared to the original weather dataset used without dropout observation. The results show that feature engineering effectively improves the short-term predictions of photovoltaic power output in buildings with a simple weather forecasting service.</jats:p>"

is derived from nuclear tests and non-exploded weapons-grade material.
Approximately one-third of the total observed Pu activity concentration is
238Pu, most likely originating from the SNAP9A satellite re-entry,
which was powered by a 238Pu thermoelectric generator. In samples from
Waldemarbreen the influence of glacial local morphology on the capability of
cryoconite for trapping and accumulating airborne radionuclides is apparent.
Local glacial morphology plays an important role in determining the
accumulation of airborne pollutants. Trace metal concentrations in soils
were typical or slightly higher than concentrations characteristic for the
natural background; the 206Pb∕207Pb signature was also close to
the natural ratio of the parent rocks. Conversely, trace metal
concentrations in cryoconite samples (Pb and Cd) were higher than in soil
samples and exceeded natural values. Cryoconite is an effective monitor of
the spread of artificial radionuclides and heavy metals in their surrounding
environment.

21234,"<jats:p> Because of the present ineffective method of soot blowing on a boiler’s heating surface in a coal-fired power plant, and to improve the economic benefit of the boiler in the power plant, weigh the improvement of boiler efficiency and steam loss brought by soot blowing, and ensure the safe operation of the unit, an optimization model of soot blowing on the boiler’s heating surface is established. Taking the economizer of the 300 MW coal-fired power plant unit as the research object, the measurement data and basic thermodynamic calculation data of the Distributed Control System (DCS) of the thermal power plant are used to calculate the fouling rate of the heated surface in real time. By analyzing the multi-group fouling rate under the same working conditions, the incremental distribution of the same measuring point at different times is obtained, and the expectation is obtained according to the distribution curve. The state of heating of the heated surface at a time in the future is predicted by the known initial cleaning state. By analyzing the trend of the fouling rate and combining the soot blowing optimization model, a set of soot blowing optimization strategies are proposed. The method proposed in this manuscript can be applied to the guidance of boiler soot blowing operation.</jats:p>"

21251,"<jats:p>Due to their advantages of self-powered capability and compact size, combined thermoelectric devices, in which a thermoelectric cooler module is driven by a thermoelectric generator module, have become promising candidates for cooling applications in extreme conditions or environments where the room is confined and the power supply is sacrificed. When the device is designed as two-stage configuration for larger temperature difference, the design degree is larger than that of a single-stage counterpart. The element number allocation to each stage in the system has a significant influence on the device performance. However, this issue has not been well-solved in previous studies. This work proposes a three-dimensional multi-physics model coupled with multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the optimal element number allocation with the coefficient of performance and cooling capacity simultaneously as multi-objective functions. This method increases the accuracy of performance prediction compared with the previously reported examples studied by the thermal resistance model. The results show that the performance of the optimized device is remarkably enhanced, where the cooling capacity is increased by 23.3% and the coefficient of performance increased by 122.0% compared with the 1# Initial Solution. The mechanism behind this enhanced performance is analyzed. The results in this paper should be beneficial for engineers and scientists seeking to design a combined thermoelectric device with optimal performance under the constraint of total element number.</jats:p>"

Among all types of material candidates for transverse thermoelectric applications, composite materials have the best cooling performance. In this study, anisotropic material properties were applied to the component phase of transverse thermoelectric composites. A mathematical model was established for predicting the performance of fibrous transverse thermoelectric composites with anisotropic components. The mathematical model was then validated by finite element analysis. The thermoelectric performance of three types of composites are presented, each with the same set of component materials. For each type of component, both anisotropic single-crystal and isotropic polycrystal material properties were applied. The results showed that the cooling capacity of the system was improved by introducing material anisotropy in the component phase of composite. The results also indicated that the orientation of the anisotropic component’s property axis, the anisotropic characteristic of a material, will significantly influence the thermoelectric performance of the composite. For a composite material consisting of Copper fiber and Bi2Te3 matrix, the maximum cooling capacity can vary as much as 50% at 300 K depending on the property axis alignment of Bi2Te3 in the composite.

This work focuses on the assessment of tantalum doping effects on the relevant structural, microstructural, optical and thermoelectric properties of ZnO. Processing of the samples with a nominal composition Zn1−xTaxO by conventional solid-state route results in limited solubility of Ta in the wurtzite structure. Electronic doping is accompanied by the formation of other defects and dislocations as a compensation mechanism and simultaneous segregation of ZnTa2O6 at the grain boundaries. Highly defective structure and partial blocking of the grain boundaries suppress the electrical transport, while the evolution of Seebeck coefficient and band gap suggest that the charge carrier concentration continuously increases from x = 0 to 0.008. Thermal conductivity is almost not affected by the tantalum content. The highest ZT~0.07 at 1175 K observed for Zn0.998Ta0.002O is mainly provided by high Seebeck coefficient (−464 V/K) along with a moderate electrical conductivity of ~13 S/cm.

As a foundational study to exhibit device performance and capabilities, melting-curve analyses were performed on 12-mer DNA duplexes in the presence/absence of two binding ligands: diminazene aceturate (DMZ) and proflavine. By measuring electrochemical current as a function of temperature, our measurement platform has the ability to determine the effect of binding ligands on Tm values with high signal-to-noise ratios and good reproducibility. We also demonstrate that heating our three-electrode cell with either an embedded microheater or a thermoelectric module produces similar results. The ΔTm values we report show the stabilizing ability of DMZ and proflavine when bound to duplex DNA structures. These initial proof-of-concept studies highlight the operating characteristics of the microdevice platform and the potential for future application toward other immobilized samples.</jats:p>"

Regarding the practical application of the RED process using natural seawater and river water, the RED performance depends on the climate (temperature).

The temperature dependence of the resistance of the solution compartment and membrane, open circuit voltage (OCV), maximum gross power output, pumping energy, and subsequent net power output of the system was individually evaluated. Increasing the temperature shows a positive influence on all the factors studied, and interesting linear relationships were obtained in all the cases, which allowed us to provide simple empirical equations to predict the resulting performance. Furthermore, the temperature dependence was strongly affected by the experimental conditions, such as the flow rate and type of stack, especially in the case of the pilot-scale stack.</jats:p>"

Gold mineralization of the Shuangwang deposit is featured by hydrothermal breccia ores with strata fragments cemented by hydrothermal minerals dominated by ankerite, quartz, and pyrite with minor amounts of calcite and albite. Pyrite is the major gold-hosting sulfide and the most abundant ore mineral. Crystal habits, thermoelectricity, and trace-element composition of pyrites from the main ore-forming stage of the Shuangwang gold deposit were studied by microbinocular, BHTE-06 thermoelectric coefficient measuring instrument, and high-resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR-ICP-MS). Spatial distribution of the above data for pyrites was delineated by contour maps of morphology index, P-type frequency, and primary halo elements (e.g., supraore halo elements Ba and Sb; near-ore halo elements Pb, Zn, and Cu; and subore halo elements Co, Mo, and Bi). Based on the above results, four target areas (areas between prospecting lines 0 and 1, between lines 14 and 18 below orebody KT9; areas between prospecting lines 30 and 34, between lines 44 and 46 below orebody KT8) were put forward for deep gold exploration in the future. These targets are consistent with the depth extrapolation of proven gold orebodies, indicating the practicality of typomorphic characterization of pyrites as vector to deep/concealed gold orebodies.

The analysis focused on how the estimated net power outputs of zeotropic mixtures compared to pure fluids are affected by the method used for specifying the performance of the heat exchangers. Four different methods were included in the assessment, which assumed that the organic Rankine cycle systems were characterized by the same values of: (1) the minimum pinch point temperature difference of the heat exchangers; (2) the mean temperature difference of the heat exchangers; (3) the heat exchanger thermal capacity (     U ¯  A    ); or (4) the heat exchanger surface area for all the considered working fluids. The second and third methods took into account the temperature difference throughout the heat transfer process, and provided the insight that the advantages of mixtures are more pronounced when large heat exchangers are economically feasible to use. The first method was incapable of this, and deemed to result in optimistic estimations of the benefits of using zeotropic mixtures, while the second and third method were deemed to result in conservative estimations. The fourth method provided the additional benefit of accounting for the degradation of heat transfer performance of zeotropic mixtures. In a net power output based performance ranking of 30 working fluids, the first method estimates that the increase in the net power output of zeotropic mixtures compared to their best pure fluid components is up to 13.6%.

The shrouded wind turbine with brimmed diffuser-augmented wind turbines (B-DAWT) has demonstrated power augmentation for a given turbine diameter and wind speed by a factor of about 2–5 compared with a bare wind turbine. In the present research, B-DAWTs are used in a multirotor system. The power output performance of MRSs using two and three B-DAWTs in a variety of configurations has been investigated in the previous works. In the present study, the aerodynamics of an MRS with five B-DAWTs, spaced in close vicinity in the same vertical plane normal to a uniform flow, has been analyzed. Power output increases of up to 21% in average for a five-rotor MRS configuration are achieved in comparison to that for the stand-alone configuration. Thus, when B-DAWTs are employed as the unit of a MRS, the total power output is remarkably increased. As the number of units for an MRS is increased from two to five, the increase in power output becomes larger and larger. This is because that the gap flows between B-DAWTs in a MRS are accelerated and cause lowered pressure regions due to vortex interaction behind the brimmed diffusers.

The process was broken down into stages, which were analyzed separately. To complete the study, an analysis of the fuel cycle and the materials used for maintenance works were included. Results showed that the most affected impact categories were water depletion (9.77 × 10−1 m3/MWh), due mainly to the high volume of water consumption in the cooling systems and the reverse osmosis process; freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecotoxicity (1.59 × 10−2 kg 1,4 -DB eq/MWh), and human toxicity (1.1 × 10−1 kg 1,4-DB eq/MWh)—due to the production and consumption of the chemicals used.

The top- or side-cover fully prevented recirculation for the raised floor configuration, while it reduced the recirculation for the hard floor configuration.

Bulk synthesis of AlSb has been reported on numerous occasions, but obtaining a single phase has always proven to be extremely difficult. This work reports a simple method for the synthesis of single-phase AlSb. Subsequently, consolidation was done into a near single-phase highly dense semiconductor in a form usable for thermoelectric applications. Further, the thermoelectric properties of this system are accounted for the first time.

The present study designs a 4GDH system utilizing excess heat from a wide area of Northern Japan and evaluates its feasibility.

Second, heat demand from both residential and commercial sectors was estimated using a 1 km mesh, and a heat load curve was created for each mesh based on load curve data. Third, the DHS was designed with excess heat plants as a supply-side heat resource, and spatial information of the demand side made use of the geographical information system (GIS). Further analysis was conducted on selected DHSs in three cities in order to evaluate those systems’ feasibility based on energy efficiency, CO2 emissions, and economic aspects.

When the degree of oxidation was 10%, the thermal conductivity of GO decreased by ~90% and this was almost independent of chiral direction. The effect of vacancy defect on the thermal conductivity of GO was also considered. The size effect of thermal conductivity gradually decreases with increasing defect concentration.

In this study, the role of the load resistance     R L     on the performance of a    μ   TEG with nanostructured materials is investigated. The interaction of the load resistance with the thermoelements exhibits interesting features, arising from the coupling of the temperature-dependent electrical and thermal transport properties at different temperature ranges and the architecture of nanostructured thermoelectric materials.

The temperature and heat flux can be calculated using the formulas if the soil temperature, soil moisture content and finned tube initial temperature are known.

A field experiment is carried out in the city of Harbin in Northeast China, where a thermoelectric power generation device has been installed and temperature data have been monitored for a certain time. The results are in good agreement with those obtained from the simulation analysis. The heat transfer processes and heat transfer steady state on the soil/finned tube interface are revealed in this work and are of great importance for the use of geothermal energy.</jats:p>"

Estimates of aboveground biomass commonly rely on measurements of tree size (diameter and height) and then indirectly relate, via allometric relationships and wood density, to biomass sampled from a relatively small number of harvested and weighed trees. Recently, however, novel in situ remote sensing techniques have been proposed, which may provide nondestructive alternative approaches to derive biomass estimates. Nonetheless, we still lack knowledge of the measurement uncertainties, as both the calibration and validation of estimates using different techniques and instruments requires consistent assessment of the underlying errors. To that end, we investigate different approaches estimating the tropical aboveground biomass in situ. We quantify the total and systematic errors among measurements obtained from terrestrial light detection and ranging (LiDAR), hypsometer-based trigonometry, and traditional forest inventory. We show that laser-based estimates of aboveground biomass are in good agreement (&lt;10% measurement uncertainty) with traditional measurements. However, relative uncertainties vary among the allometric equations based on the vegetation parameters used for parameterization. We report the error metrics for measurements of tree diameter and tree height and discuss the consequences for estimated biomass. Despite methodological differences detected in this study, we conclude that laser-based electronic devices could complement conventional measurement techniques, thereby potentially improving estimates of tropical vegetation biomass.</jats:p>"

21670,"<jats:p>Waste heat that is available in the flue gas of power plant stacks is a potential source of useful thermal power. In reclaiming and utilizing this waste heat without compromising plant efficiency, stacks usually need to be equipped with forced-draught fans in order to compensate for the decrease in natural draught while stack gas is cooled. In addition, pumps are used to circulate the heat transfer fluid. All of these parasitic operations require electrical power. Electrical power has unit exergy of almost 1 W/W. On the contrary, the thermal power exergy that is claimed from the low-enthalpy flue gas has much lower unit exergy. Therefore, from an exergetic point of view, the additional electrical exergy that is required to drive pumps and fans must not exceed the thermal exergy claimed. Based on the First-Law of Thermodynamics, the net energy that is saved may be positive with an apparently high coefficient of performance; however, the same generally does not hold true for the Second-Law. This is a matter of determining the optimum amount of heat to be claimed and the most rational method of utilizing this heat for maximum net exergy gain from the process, under variable outdoor conditions and the plant operations. The four main methods were compared. These are (a) electricity generation by thermoelectric generators, electricity generation with an Organic-Rankine Cycle with (b) or without (c) a heat pump, and (d) the direct use of the thermal exergy that is gained in a district energy system. The comparison of these methods shows that exergy-rationality is the best for method (b). A new analytical optimization algorithm and the exergy-based optimum control strategy were developed, which determine the optimum pump flow rate of the heat recovery system and then calculate how much forced-draft fan power is required in the stack at dynamic operating conditions. Robust design metrics were established to maximize the net exergy gain, including an exergy-based coefficient of performance. Parametric studies indicate that the exergetic approach provides a better insight by showing that the amount of heat that can be optimally recovered is much different than the values given by classical economic and energy efficiency considerations. A case study was performed for method (d), which shows that, without any exergy rationality-based control algorithm and design method, the flue gas heat recovery may not be feasible in district energy systems or any other methods of utilization of the heat recovered. The study has implications in the field, since most of the waste heat recovery units in industrial applications, which are designed based on the First-Law of Thermodynamics, result in exergy loss instead of exergy gain, and are therefore responsible for more carbon dioxide emissions. These applications must be retrofitted with new exergy-based controllers for variable speed pumps and fans with optimally selected capacities.</jats:p>"

This characterization plays an important role in determining the best position of a photovoltaic (PV) and thermoelectric generator (TEG) in a PV-TEG system. The light spectrum was recorded using mini USB spectrometer hardware and Spectragryph version 1.2.8 software as optical spectroscopic software that displays light records coming with wavelength (nm) on the x-axis and light spectrum intensity in arbitrary units (a.u.) on the y-axis. The measurement results show that the light intensity in the visible light region (300–750) nm is more dominant than the intensity in infrared light (&gt;750 nm), so that the PV placement is preferred over TEG. Furthermore, with a cold mirror, PV is more suitable if placed in a position to receive reflected light, while using a hot mirror is more suitable in the position transmitted light. For TEG, it is placed in a position opposite to PV. As a result, the maximum intensity of the PV light spectrum with cold mirrors is 46.52 a.u at a wavelength of 479.6 nm, while with hot mirrors it is 42.07 a.u with a 457.6 nm wavelength. It can be concluded that the value of the light intensity with a cold mirror is better than that with a hot mirror on the visible light (Vis) spectrum, and the current and voltage are equivalent to the results of the radiation energy area. It was proven that the maximum total output of a hybrid PV-TEG system with Cold Mirror is greater than that with Hot Mirror (100.53 &gt; 68.77) × 10−3 µW. Based on the result of this study, it is recommended that further research can be conducted to increase radiation energy and output power in TEG.</jats:p>"

Four scenarios were established considering the coupling of Calcium Looping (CaL) processes to capture CO2 emitted from thermoelectric using coal and natural gas: S1: the current condition of the Brazilian grid; S2 and S3: Brazilian grid with CaL applied individually to coal (TEC) and gas (TGN) operated thermoelectric; and S4: CaL is simultaneously coupled to both sources. Global warming potential (GWP) expressed the environmental dimension, Primary Energy Demand (PED) was the energy indicator and Levelised Cost of Energy described the economic range. Attributional Life Cycle Assessment for generation of 1.0 MWh was applied in the analysis. None of the scenarios accumulated the best indexes in all dimensions. Regarding GWP, S4 totals the positive effects of using CaL to reduce CO2 from TEC and TGN, but the CH4 emissions increased due to its energy requirements. As for PED, S1 and S2 are similar and presented higher performances than S3 and S4. The price of natural gas compromises the use of CaL in TGN. A combined verification of the three analysis dimensions, proved that S2 was the best option of the series due to the homogeneity of its indices. The installation of CaL in TECs and TGNs was effective to capture and store CO2 emissions, but the costs of this system should be reduced and its energy efficiency still needs to be improved.</jats:p>"

Additionally, the precise PV power output prediction in an hourly manner enables more sophisticated strategies for PV operators and markets as the electricity price in a renewable energy market is continuously changing. However, the hourly prediction of PV power outputs is considered as a challenging problem due to the dynamic natures of meteorological information not only in a day but also across days. Therefore, in this paper, we suggest three PV power output prediction methods such as artificial neural network (ANN)-, deep neural network (DNN)-, and long and short term memory (LSTM)-based models that are capable to understand the hidden relationships between meteorological information and actual PV power outputs. In particular, the proposed LSTM based model is designed to capture both hourly patterns in a day and seasonal patterns across days. We conducted the experiments by using a real-world dataset.

Thin films were fabricated by magnetron sputtering using the Ge–Au alloy target onto glass substrates at two various conditions; during one of the sputtering processes, the external substrate bias voltage (Ub = −150 V) was used. After deposition thin films were annealed in the atmosphere of N2 at various temperatures (473, 523 and 573 K) to investigate the influence of annealing temperature on the electric and thermoelectric properties of films.

21977,"<jats:p>The trade-off between large power output, high efficiency and small fluctuations in the operation of heat engines has recently received interest in the context of thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). Here we provide a concrete illustration of this trade-off by theoretically investigating the operation of a quantum point contact (QPC) with an energy-dependent transmission function as a steady-state thermoelectric heat engine. As a starting point, we review and extend previous analysis of the power production and efficiency. Thereafter the power fluctuations and the bound jointly imposed on the power, efficiency, and fluctuations by the TURs are analyzed as additional performance quantifiers. We allow for arbitrary smoothness of the transmission probability of the QPC, which exhibits a close to step-like dependence in energy, and consider both the linear and the non-linear regime of operation. It is found that for a broad range of parameters, the power production reaches nearly its theoretical maximum value, with efficiencies more than half of the Carnot efficiency and at the same time with rather small fluctuations. Moreover, we show that by demanding a non-zero power production, in the linear regime a stronger TUR can be formulated in terms of the thermoelectric figure of merit. Interestingly, this bound holds also in a wide parameter regime beyond linear response for our QPC device.</jats:p>"

The results of UL-94HB and LOI test method for composite materials including 20 wt.% fly ash (modified by NaOH) reached 13.45 mm/min and 22.4%, respectively. These results showed that fly ash is an efficient additive as a flame retardant which decreases the amounts of additives in products and improves their efficiency. Fly ash was also dispersed into epoxy resin to enhance its resistance to oxidation.</jats:p>"

The alloys’ durability is crucial for their commercial handling and use, and therefore it is required to characterize their surface oxidation behavior and stability at the working temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was utilized to study the surface composition and oxidation of the ZrNiSn alloy at room and elevated temperatures. It was found that during heating in a vacuum, Sn segregates to the surface in order to reduce the surface energy. Exposing the alloy to oxygen resulted mainly in the oxidation of the zirconium to ZrO2, as well as some minor oxidation of Sn. At room temperature, the oxidation to ZrO2 was accompanied by the formation of a thin ZrO layer at the metal-oxide interface. In contrast to TiNiSn, where most of the oxide was formed on the surface due to oxygen-enhanced segregation of Ti, and in the case of ZrNiSn, the formed oxide layer was thinner.

In Morocco, the Jorf Lasfar Thermal Power Station produces two types of coal ash with enormous quantities: fly ash (FA) and Bottom ash (BA). FA is recovered in cement while BA is stored in landfills. To reduce the effects of BA disposal in landfills, several experimental studies have tested the possibility of their recovery in the road construction, especially as a subbase. In the first phase of this study, the BA underwent a physicochemical and geotechnical characterization. The results obtained show that the BA should be treated to improve its mechanical properties. The most commonly used materials are lime and cement. In the selected low-cost treatment, which is the subject of the second phase of the study, lime is used to improve the low pozzolanicity of BA while calcarenite sand is used to increase the compactness. Several mixtures containing BA, lime, and calcarenite sand were prepared. Each of these mixtures was compacted in modified Proctor molds and then subjected to a series of tests to study the following characteristics: compressive strength, dry and wet California Bearing Ratio (CBR), dry density and swelling. The composition of each mixture was based on an experimental design approach. The results show that the values of the compressive strength, the dry density, and the CBR index have increased after treatment, potentially leading to a valorization of the treated BA for use in a subbase.</jats:p>"

Without greenhouse gas emissions, solar thermal power stations may play a vital role in the energy industry because they have a potential to produce electricity for 24 h per day. The goal of this study is to select solar thermal power stations from three regions (i.e., the United States, Spain and the other nations) throughout the world and to identify which region most efficiently produces solar thermal power energy. To measure their efficiencies, we use data envelopment analysis as a method to examine the performance of these power stations. Our empirical results show that the United States currently fields the most efficient solar thermal power stations. This study also finds that parabolic trough technology slightly outperforms the other two technologies (i.e., heliostat power tower and linear Fresnel reflector), but not at the level of statistical significance. In addition to the proposed efficiency assessment, we incorporate a new way of finding a possible existence of congestion. The phenomenon of congestion is separated into output-based and input-based occurrences. Output-based congestion implies a capacity limit (e.g., difficulties in transmission, voltage control and dispatch scheduling) in a grid network between generation and end users. Input-based congestion occurs when generators use “uncontrollable inputs” (e.g., sunlight hours). Renewable energy sources, such as solar thermal power, are indeed important for our future sustainability. However, this needs performance assessment on generation and transmission through which electricity generated by renewable energy is conveyed to end users.

These microscale models were done with hourly MERRA-2 data that included wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and atmospheric pressure with records from 1980–2018 and taking into account roughness, orography, and climatology of the site. Wind speed daily profile for each model was compared to electricity demand trajectory, and it was seen that wind speed has a peak at the same time. The amount of power delivered to the electric grid with this cogeneration in Rio Bravo and Altamira (Northeast region) is 2657.02 MW and for Tuxpan and Dos Bocas from the Eastern region is 3196.18 MW. This implies a reduction at the peak demand. In the Northeast region, the power demand at the peak is 8000 MW, and for Eastern region 7200 MW.

22253,"<jats:p>This study was conducted to analyze the impact of surrounding environmental changes on the feedback gain and performance of a closed-loop wind farm controller that reduces the error between total power output of wind farm and power command of transmission system operator. To analyze the impact of environment changes on wind farm controller feedback gain, the feedback gain was manually changed from 0 to 0.9 with a 0.1 interval. In this study, wind speed and wind direction changes were considered as environment changes; it was found by simulation code that the wind farm controller gain is in inverse proportion to wake recovery rate. In other words, the feedback gain should be higher if the distance between upstream and downstream wind turbine is not sufficient to wake recovery. Furthermore, the feedback gain should be lower when the upstream wind turbine generates a relatively weak wake by operating above the rated wind speed. The wind farm simulation was performed using reference 5 MW wind turbines from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which are numerically modeled for each element so that wind farm power output and tower load can be calculated according to the variation of the power command by using a modified wake model with improved accuracy. All the simulations performed in this study were carried out to review the power output accuracy of wind farms, but only if the transmission system operator’s power command was lower than the available power of wind farm. In this study, the gain of the wind farm controller was applied differently depending on the wind speed and direction to consider benefits in terms of power and tower load, especially if the wake effect of the upstream wind turbine was rapidly transferred to the downstream wind turbine.

22263,"<jats:p>Drying is a critical point for the exploitation of biomass for energy production. High moisture content negatively affects the efficiency of power generation in combustion and gasification systems. Different types of dryers are available however; it is known that rotary dryers have low cost of maintenance and consume 15% and 30% less in terms of specific energy. The study analyzed the drying process of woody residues using a new prototype of mobile rotary dryer cocurrent flow. Woodchip of poplar (Populus spp.), black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), and grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) pruning were dried in a rotary drier. The drying cycle lasted 8 h for poplar, 6 h for black locust, and 6 h for pruning of grapevine. The initial biomass had a moisture content of around 50% for the poplar and around 30% for grapevine and black locust. The study showed that some characteristics of the biomass (e.g., initial moisture content, particle size distribution, bulk density) influence the technical parameters (i.e., airflow temperature, rate, and speed) of the drying process and, hence, the energy demand. At the end of the drying process, 17% of water was removed for poplar wood chips and 31% for grapevine and black locust wood chips. To achieve this, result the three-biomass required 1.61 (poplar), 0.86 (grapevine), and 1.12 MJ kgdry solids−1 (black locust), with an efficiency of thermal drying (η) respectively of 37%, 12%, and 27%.

For this reason, the power output of such CSP plants is generally scheduled to maximize the operating revenue by participating in electric markets, which can result in frequent changes in the power reference signal and introduces challenges to real-time power tracking. To address this issue, this paper systematically studies the execution-level power tracking control strategy of an CSP plant, primarily aiming at coordinating the control of the sluggish steam generator (including the economizer, the boiler, and the superheater) and the fast steam turbine. The governing equations of the key energy conversion processes in the CSP plant are first presented and used as the simulation platform. Then, the transient behavior of the CSP plant is analyzed to gain an insight into the system dynamic characteristics and control difficulties. Then, based on the step-response data, the transfer functions of the CSP plant are identified, which form the prediction model of the model predictive controller. Finally, two control strategies are studied through simulation experiments: (1) the heuristic PI control with two operation modes, which can be conveniently implemented but cannot coordinate the control of the power tracking speed and the main steam parameters, and (2) advanced model predictive control (MPC), which overcomes the shortcoming of PI (Proportional-Integral) control and can significantly improve the control performance.</jats:p>"

In particular, we realized a comparison in terms of measurement repeatability and reliability, as well as power consumption and battery lasting, between two sensory gloves implemented by means of different technologies. The first is a 3D printed glove with 10 DoF, featuring low-cost, low-effort fabrication and low-power consumption. The second is a classical Lycra® glove with 14 DoF suitable for a more detailed assessment of the hand postures, featuring a relatively higher cost and power consumption. An electronic circuitry was designed to gather and elaborate data from both types of sensory gloves, differing for number of inputs only.  Both gloves are equipped with flex sensors and in addiction with the electronics (including a microcontroller and a transmitter) allow the control of hand virtual limbs or mechanical arts in surgical, military, space and civil applications.Six healthy subjects were involved in tests suitable to evaluate the performances of the proposed gloves in terms of repeatability, reproducibility and reliability. Particular effort was devoted to increase battery lasting for both glove-based systems, with the electronics relaying on Radio Frequency, Piezoelectric and Thermoelectric harvesters. The harvesting part was built and tested as a prototype discrete element board, that is interfaced with an external microcontroller and a radiofrequency transmitter board.

The latter technology has demonstrated the highest efficiencies at small and intermediate scales and low to medium heat-source temperatures and is considered a suitable option for WHR in relevant applications. However, ORC systems experience variations in performance at part-load or off-design conditions, which need to be predicted accurately by empirical or physics-based models if one is to assess accurately the techno-economic potential of such ORC-WHR solutions. This paper presents results from an experimental investigation of the part-load performance of a 1-kWe ORC engine, operated with R245fa as a working fluid, with the aim of producing high-fidelity steady-state and transient data relating to the operational performance of this system. The experimental apparatus is composed of a rotary-vane pump, brazed-plate evaporator and condenser units and a scroll expander magnetically coupled to a generator with an adjustable resistive load. An electric heater is used to provide a hot oil-stream to the evaporator, supplied at three different temperatures in the current study: 100, 120 and 140     ∘    C. The optimal operating conditions, that is, pump speed and expander load, are determined at various heat-source conditions, thus resulting in a total of 124 steady-state data points used to analyse the part-load performance of the engine. A maximum thermal efficiency of 4.2 ± 0.1% is reported for a heat-source temperature of 120      ∘    C, while a maximum net power output of 508 ± 2 W is obtained for a heat-source temperature at 140      ∘    C. For a 100-     ∘    C heat source, a maximum exergy efficiency of 18.7 ± 0.3% is achieved. A detailed exergy analysis allows us to quantify the contribution of each component to the overall exergy destruction. The share of the evaporator, condenser and expander components are all significant for the three heat-source conditions, while the exergy destroyed in the pump is negligible by comparison (below 4%). The data can be used for the development and validation of advanced models capable of steady-state part-load and off-design performance predictions, as well as predictions of the transient/dynamic operation of ORC systems.</jats:p>"

22397,"<jats:p>The performance of piezoelectric actuator ceramics under strong electric field(20 kV/cm) and variable temperature (30~150℃) were tested on a piezoelectric ceramic thermo-electro-mechanical multi-field loading test bench. The variation of hysteresis loop, strain loop, free capacitor and dielectric loss tangent with temperature was analyzed. A mathematical model of displacement characteristics of ceramic materials considering temperature effect is established, and the accuracy of the model is verified. The results show that the hysteresis loops become slender with the increasing of temperature, while the residual polarization, maximum polarization and coercive field decrease. The effect of the temperature on the residual polarization and coercive field is stronger than that on maximum polarization. The strain loop presents a typical butterfly curve, and the negative strain decreases gradually to 0.12% with the increasing of temperature. In the unipolar electric field, the residual polarization varies slightly with the increasing of temperature, and the maximum polarization increases about 40%. The piezoelectric constant of the material increases linearly. The free capacitor and dielectric loss tangent increases continuously. The higher the temperature, the greater the increase.</jats:p>"

In this work, the fluid dynamic interaction between waves and a U-shaped OWC breakwater embedding a Wells turbine has been investigated through unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. The full-scale plant installed in the harbor of Civitavecchia (Italy) was numerically modeled. A two-dimensional domain was adopted to simulate the unsteady flow, both outside and inside the U-OWC device, including the air chamber and the oscillating flow inside the conduit hosting the Wells turbine. For the numerical simulation of the damping effect induced by the Wells turbine connected to the air chamber, a porous medium was placed in the computational domain, representing the conduit hosting the turbine. Several simulations were carried out considering periodic waves with different periods and amplitudes, getting a deep insight into the energy conversion process from wave to the turbine power output. For this purpose, the three main steps of the overall energy conversion process have been examined. Firstly, from the wave power to the power of the water oscillating flow inside the U-duct. Secondly, from the power of the oscillating water flow to the air pneumatic power. Finally, from the air pneumatic power to the Wells turbine power output. Results show that the U-OWC can capture up to 66% of the incoming wave power, in the case of a wave period close to the eigenperiod of the plant. However, only two-thirds of the captured energy flux is available to the turbine, being partially dissipated due to the losses in the U-duct and the air chamber. Finally, the overall time-average turbine power output is evaluated showing that it is strongly influenced by a suitable choice of the turbine characteristics (mainly geometry and rotational speed).</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>Thermal stress induced by an uneven temperature field and mismatched thermal expansion is known to be a dominating factor in the debonding mechanism that threatens reliability and ultimately leads to failure in thermoelectric (TE) composites. Accordingly, we analyse the stress distributions in a TE composite induced by the presence of an elliptic inhomogeneity embedded in the surrounding matrix material. Using complex variable methods, we obtain closed-form representations of the thermal–electric and thermal–elastic fields and find that the temperature field around the inhomogeneity is reduced dramatically by the application of a remote electric current density without affecting the temperature difference across the inhomogeneity–matrix interface. This ensures the conversion efficiency of the TE composite while improving its reliability. Numerical results illustrate that a suitable choice of electric current density can prevent interfacial debonding via the suppression of the maximum positive normal stress on the interface.</jats:p>"

The volume optimization calculations of these materials agree well with experimental as well as available theoretical values. From the energy dispersion curves as well as DOS plots, all the investigated alkali fluroperovskites are found to have an indirect bandgap in [Formula: see text]-M direction using both approximations. The second-order elastic constants as well as mechanical properties such as Young’s modulus, shear modulus, density, anisotropic factor, B/G[Formula: see text] ratio are also computed for these materials. In order to study the thermal and vibrational effects on the studied fluroperovskites, we have employed the quasi-harmonic Debye model that uses a set of energy versus volume calculations. The effects of temperature as well as pressure on the structural parameters are also studied using the non-equilibrium Gibbs function.

Using complex variable methods, we obtain closed-form solutions describing the corresponding thermoelastic fields in the vicinity of the nano-hole. Our results indicate that the effect of surface elasticity is to generate significant normal and shear stresses on the boundary of the hole, allowing for the ability to either suppress or enhance hoop stress depending on the sign of the corresponding surface material constant. In addition, we find that positive hoop stress generated on the boundary by the remote electric current density can be neutralized by the incorporation of positive surface elasticity. In the case of the remaining boundary stress components, both surface elasticity and electric current density are found to enhance normal stress, while the maximum shear stress depends largely on the contribution of surface elasticity. </jats:p>"

23451,"<jats:p>The performance of the photovoltaic-thermoelectric (PV-TE) hybrid system was examined using three types of PV cells and a thermoelectric generator (TEG) based on bismuth telluride. The investigated PV cells are amorphous silicon (a-Si), monocrystalline silicon (mono-Si), and cadmium telluride (CdTe). The results showed that the TEG contribution can overcome the degradation of the PV cell efficiency with increasing temperature at the minimal working condition. This condition corresponds to the critical temperature difference across the TEG that guarantees the same efficiency of the hybrid system as that of the PV cell alone at 298 K. The obtained results showed that the critical temperature difference is 13.3 K, 44.1 K, and 105 K for the a-Si, CdTe, and mono-Si PV cell, respectively. In addition, the general expression of the temperature difference across the TEG needed for an efficiency enhancement by a ratio of r compared with a PV cell alone at 298 K was given. For an efficiency enhancement by 5 % (r = 1.05), the temperature difference required is 30.2 K, 61.3 K, and 116.1 K for the a-Si, CdTe, and mono-Si PV cells, respectively. These values cannot be achieved practically only in the case of the a-Si PV cell. Moreover, a TE material with a high power factor can reduce this temperature difference and improve the performance of the hybrid system. This work provides a tool that may be useful during the selection of the PV cell and the TE material for the hybrid system.</jats:p>"

23460,"<jats:p>Calcium chloride hexahydrate (CaCl2·6H2O) is an attractive candidate as a phase change material for supplemental cooling in air-cooled thermal power-plant since it has a low-phase transition temperature of 29.3 °C and a relatively large volumetric energy storage density of 289 MJ/m3. The volumetric energy storage density is approximately double the energy densities of comparable paraffins with similar melting points. However, calcium chloride hexahydrate often requires high degree of supercooling to initiate solidification and long-term thermal stability has impeded the adoption of calcium chloride hexahydrate in the latent heat thermal energy storage system. There are only a few literatures which report on long-term stability of pure calcium chloride hexahydrate accurately. In this paper, the effects of sodium chloride and strontium chloride in mitigating supercooling in calcium chloride hexahydrate over 1000 melt–freeze cycles and thermal stability at elevated temperatures were studied in large sample size. Since there is not much data available on calcium chloride hexahydrate with nucleating additives, the current data available do not provide an insight into the effects of thermal cycling on supercooling. Therefore, this study also aims to measure the reliability of calcium chloride hexahydrate and report it, in terms of variations in melting temperature, supercooling, energy storage density, and change in mass over 1000 melt–freeze cycles. The results have shown that strontium chloride as heterogenous nucleators reduces supercooling by 2.5 °C and survived up to 1000 melt–freeze cycles (i.e., 2.7 years).</jats:p>"

23539,"<jats:p> Structural, electronic, optical and thermoelectric response of the cubic RhTiSb compound is reported using TB-mBJ potential. The calculated results for the band structure and DOS confirm that the RhTiSb is a nonmagnetic (NM) semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 0.71 eV. The main optical parameters such as dielectric function, absorption coefficient, refractive index and optical reflectivity were estimated for emission upto 14 eV. The RhTiSb half-Heusler exhibits a maximum absorption in the visible and ultraviolet region. By using the Boltzmann transport equations as incorporated in BoltzTraP code, the thermoelectric characteristics were calculated. The main properties which describe the aptitude of material in thermoelectric environment such as Seebeck coefficient and figure of merit were calculated. The high values of figure-of-merit (ZT [Formula: see text] 0.7) were observed in large range of temperature indicating that RhTiSb have a good thermoelectric performance. </jats:p>"

23600,"<jats:p> Miniaturization of electronic devices with more computing power has created a challenging set of aspects in thermal management. Present work is based on phase change materials microsphere and its incorporation in the epoxy network to develop a new class of potting material facilitating thermal management for miniaturized electronic devices. A facile and scalable method was implemented to synthesize paraffin wax microspheres (PMPs). It was dispersed into a room temperature curing epoxy network to fabricate the epoxy composite with high latent heat of fusion and high thermal stability. PMPs obtained have spherical morphology with an average diameter of approximately 5 µm. The PMP/epoxy composite can store 34.34 and 49.3 J g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> of latent heat energy at 30 and 40 wt% PMP loading, respectively. Leakage test reveals that leaching declined as the size of PMP is reduced. Incorporation of PMP into the epoxy network reduces the compressive strength, but still resilient enough to protect electronic devices. This is an added advantage over the potential to mitigate the issue of hot spot in electronic devices as demonstrated by infrared thermography. The application of such composite is not limited only as electronic potting materials but also has the potential for other thermal energy storage applications. </jats:p>"

According to our calculations, we have found that our structural and electronic parameters, such as the lattice parameter, energy bandgap, the tetragonal ratio, the displacement of the anions, are in very good agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical results. Based on the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approximations, we were able to compute the elastic constants: the compressibility, Young’s and the shear’s moduli, the average velocity of the elastic waves, the Debye temperature and the Poisson’s coefficient of the chalcopyrite LiPN<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and NaPN<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>.

Helium bubble damage evolution in terms of number density, size, and total volume contribution to grain matrices has been determined as a function of He+ implantation fluence. The outputs were compared to previously published results on severe plastically deformed (SPD) tungsten implanted under the same conditions. Large helium bubbles were formed on the grain boundaries and helium bubble damage evolution profiles are shown to differ among the different materials with less overall damage in the nanocrystalline tungsten.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and x-ray diffraction show certain black spots appearing after thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. TEM and APT analysis correlated the black spots with second-phase particles rich in Cr and V. No sign of irradiation-created dislocation loops, even after 8 dpa, was observed. Furthermore, nanomechanical testing shows a large hardness of 14 GPa in the as-deposited samples, with near negligible irradiation hardening.

24247,"<jats:p>The diffusion process of multiple He atoms in W is simulated by a molecular dynamics (MD) method with the W-H-He analytic bond-order potential. The diffusivities of different number of helium (He) atoms in W are determined by the mean squared displacement (MSD) method at different temperatures. The diffusivity-temperature (D-T) relationship is fitted to the Arrhenius equation to obtain the pre-factor and the diffusion barrier. Under the temperature of 1200K He atoms diffuse together, and above 1200K they separate from each other. When the number of He atoms is greater than three, all He atoms oscillate at the tetrahedral interstitial site (TIS) instead of diffusing under 400K. In the temperature range of 400-1200K, the diffusion barriers of He atoms, the number of which is from two to five, are 0.098, 0.170, 0.125 and 0.112eV, respectively. Contrasting with one He atom (0.058eV), the higher diffusion barriers reflect a greater difficulty in diffusion of multiple He atoms in W. In addition, when the number of He atoms is over five, vacancies are formed in W, and He atoms occupy the vacancies.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we present our last results on the effect of postprocessing allowing optimization of the magnetoimpedance effect in Co-rich microwires suitable for magnetic microsensor applications. Giant magnetoimpedance effect improvement was achieved either by annealing or stress-annealing. Annealed Co-rich presents rectangular hysteresis loops. However, an improvement in magnetoimpedance ratio is observed at fairly high annealing temperatures over a wide frequency range. Application of stress during annealing at moderate values of annealing temperatures and stress allows for a remarkable decrease in coercivity and increase in squareness ratio and further giant magnetoimpedance effect improvement. Stress-annealing, carried out at sufficiently high temperatures and/or stress allowed induction of transverse magnetic anisotropy, as well as magnetoimpedance effect improvement. Enhanced magnetoimpedance ratio values for annealed and stress-annealed samples and frequency dependence of the magnetoimpedance are discussed in terms of the radial distribution of the magnetic anisotropy. Accordingly, we demonstrated that the giant magnetoimpedance effect of Co-rich microwires can be tailored by controlling the magnetic anisotropy of Co-rich microwires, using appropriate thermal treatment.</jats:p>"

In addition, the effect of adding Co content on the improvement of the soft magnetic properties of the nanocomposites was carried out. The nanocomposites were fabricated using the powder metallurgy process. The iron-aluminum metal matrix reinforced multi-walled carbon nanotube (Fe-Al-MWCNT) nanocomposites showed a continuous increase of saturation magnetization from 90.70 A·m2/kg to 167.22 A·m2/kg and microhardness, whereas the electrical resistivity dropped as the Al content increased. The incorporation of Co nanoparticles in Fe-Al-MWCNT up to 35 vol% of Co considerably improved the soft magnetic properties of the nanocomposites by reducing the coercivity and retentivity up to 42% and 47%, respectively. The results showed that Al-based magnetic nanocomposites with a high Al volume content can be tailored using ferromagnetic particles. The composites with a volume content of magnetic particles (Fe+Co) greater than 60 vol% exhibited higher saturation magnetization, higher coercivity, and higher retentivity than the standard Sendust core. Moreover, the produced composites can be used for the lightweight magnetic core in electromagnetic devices due to their low density and good magnetic and mechanical properties.</jats:p>"
24312,"<jats:p>A facile and cheap surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method was used to prepare mesoporous cobalt ferrite nanosystems with BET surface area up to 151 m2/g. These mesostructures with high BET surface areas and pore sizes are made from assemblies of nanoparticles (NPs) with average sizes between 7.8 and 9.6 nm depending on the initial pH conditions. The pH proved to be the key factor for controlling not only NP size, but also the phase purity and the porosity properties of the mesostructures. At pH values lower than 7, a parasite hematite phase begins to form. The sample obtained at pH = 7.3 has magnetization at saturation Ms = 38 emu/g at 300 K (54.3 emu/g at 10 K) and BET surface area SBET = 151 m2/g, whereas the one obtained at pH = 8.3 has Ms = 68 emu/g at 300 K (83.6 emu/g at 10 K) and SBET = 101 m2/g. The magnetic coercive field values at 10 K are high at up to 12,780 Oe, with a maximum coercive field reached for the sample obtained at pH = 8.3. Decreased magnetic performances are obtained at pH values higher than 9. The iron occupancies of the tetrahedral and octahedral sites belonging to the cobalt ferrite spinel structure were extracted through decomposition of the Mössbauer patterns in spectral components. The magnetic anisotropy constants of the investigated NPs were estimated from the temperature dependence of the hyperfine magnetic field. Taking into consideration the high values of BET surface area and the magnetic anisotropy constants as well as the significant magnetizations for saturation at ambient temperature, and the fact that all parameters can be adjusted through the initial pH conditions, these materials are very promising as recyclable anti-polluting agents, magnetically separable catalysts, and targeted drug delivery vehicles.</jats:p>"

24314,"<jats:p>The capability of synthesizing specific nanoparticles (NPs) by varying their shape, size and composition in a controlled fashion represents a typical set of engineering tools that tune the NPs magnetic response via their anisotropy. In particular, variations in NP composition mainly affect the magnetocrystalline anisotropy component, while the different magnetic responses of NPs with isotropic (i.e., spherical) or elongated shapes are mainly caused by changes in their shape anisotropy. In this context, we propose a novel route to obtain monodispersed, partially hollow magnetite nanorods (NRs) by colloidal synthesis, in order to exploit their shape anisotropy to increase the related coercivity; we then modify their composition via a cation exchange (CE) approach. The combination of a synthetic and post-synthetic approach on NRs gave rise to dramatic variations in their magnetic features, with the pores causing an initial magnetic hardening that was further enhanced by the post-synthetic introduction of a manganese oxide shell. Indeed, the coupling of the core and shell ferrimagnetic phases led to even harder magnetic NRs.</jats:p>"

Based on these results, we attempted to evaluate the creep-fatigue of tempered ferritic steel with the support of microstructural evaluation such as dislocations and precipitates. The dynamic coercivity decreases with fatigue life fraction and closely related to the number of Cr23C6 precipitates with N0.8 and the dislocation density with ρ0.4 In addition, Vickers’s hardness continuously decreased up to the failure deducing the softening of mechanical strength. In conclusion, it can nondestructively characterize the influence of the precipitates and dislocation density on the dynamic coercivity of ferritic steel during creep-fatigue.</jats:p>"

The classical heat treatment process (with heating rate 10 °C/min) in vacuum for wound toroidal cores was optimized in the temperature range from 280 to 430 °C in order to obtain the best magnetic properties (magnetic saturation Bs and coercivity Hc obtained from the B(H) dependencies) at 50 Hz frequency. For optimal heat-treated samples, the complex magnetic permeability in the frequencies 104–108 Hz at room temperature was measured. Finally, magnetic core losses were obtained for 1 T/50 Hz and 1.5 T/50 Hz values for samples annealed at T = 310 °C.

The alloys were produced using two production methods with similar cooling rates: Injection casting and suction casting. The alloy samples produced were subjected to isothermal annealing at 940 K for 10 min. The structure of the materials was examined using X-ray diffraction. Isothermal annealing has led to the formation of various crystallization products depending on the chemical composition of the alloy and the structure of the alloy in a solidified state. In two cases, the product of crystallization was the hard magnetic phase Y2Fe14B. However, the mechanism of this phase formation was different in both cases. The magnetic properties of alloys were tested using a vibrating sample magnetometer and a Faraday magnetic balance. It is found that the grain crystallite size of the crystalline phases have a decisive influence on the value of the coercive field (especially in the case of hard magnetic phases). It has been shown that privileged areas can already be created during the production process. Their presence determines the crystallization process.</jats:p>"

24327,"<jats:p>Cobalt nano-rods with the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure were prepared by reduction of the long-chain carboxylate Co (II) precursor in polyol. The application of an external magnetic field (µ0H = 1.25 T) during the nucleation and growth steps resulted in a noticeable modification of the mean aspect ratio (length/diameter) of the particles. The particle morphology was also modified as the nano-rods did not exhibit conical heads at their extremities anymore, which are observed for particles prepared without application of an external magnetic field. Besides, the stacking faults density along the c axis of the hcp structure in the cobalt nano-rods has been found to decrease with the increase in the applied magnetic field. The coercive field of randomly oriented nano-rods increased with the aspect ratio, showing the highest value (i.e., 5.8 kOe at 300 K) for the cobalt nano-rods obtained under the highest applied magnetic field. For partially oriented Co nano-rods in toluene solution, the magnetic properties were significantly enhanced with a coercive field of 7.2 kOe at 140 K, while the magnetization saturation reached 92% of the bulk.

The phase formation of M-type hexaferrite (HF) for both compositions was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) powder pattern, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) micrographs, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra, and elemental mappings. The magnetic properties at room temperature (RT) and low temperature (T = 10 K) were also investigated. M-H loops revealed ferrimagnetic nature for various prepared nanohexaferrites via sol-gel and ultrasonication routes. The Ms (saturation magnetization) and Mr (remanence) values increased with increasing Tm-Sm substituting contents. Ms and Mr reached their maximum values at x = 0.04 in the case of samples prepared using the sol-gel technique and at x = 0.03 for those prepared via ultrasonication route. M-H loops were very broad in samples prepared via ultrasonication route in comparison to those produced by means of the sol-gel approach, implying that the products synthesized via ultrasonication route have greater values of coercivity (Hc). The variations in Hc values with respect to Tm-Sm substitutions were governed by the evolutions in the magneto-crystalline anisotropy. Diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were employed to estimate the direct band gap of pristine and co-substituted Sr0.5Ba0.5Fe12O19 hexaferrites. Optical energy band gaps (Eg) of pristine samples were significantly tuned by co-substitution of Tm3+ and Sm3+ ions.

Due to the high sensitivity of the magnetisation vector to any inhomogeneities occurring in these alloys, it is possible to assess indirectly structural defects. This paper presents the results of research on the structure and magnetic properties of bulk amorphous alloys with a high content of Fe and Co. The magnetic properties of the produced alloys were tested using a Faraday magnetic balance and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). Analysis of the magnetisation process in the region known as the approach to ferromagnetic saturation was carried out in accordance with Kronmüller’s theorem. Magnetisation in magnetic fields of greater than the effective anisotropy field (Holstein-Primakoff para-process) was also studied. For the studied alloys, it was found that an increase in Fe content causesan increase in saturation magnetisation, and decreases in the values of the coercive field and thespin-wave stiffness parameter, Dspf. A relationship was observed between the width of the amorphous halo and the value of the coercive field. However, no significant links were found between either the presence of structural defects and the properties of these materials, or between the Co content and the value of the coercive field.</jats:p>"

Single crystal X-ray diffractometry shows that annealing a crystal after the initial synthesis has an impact on the Al content on the octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated sites. Furthermore, it was found that heating in a corundum crucible increases the overall Al content.

Using single track printing the stability of the melt pool was investigated under changing process parameters. The influence of changing laser power, scanning speed, and powder layer thickness on density, porosity structure, microstructure, phase composition, and magnetic properties were investigated. The results showed that energy density coupled with powder layer thickness plays a crucial role in melt-track stability. It was possible to manufacture magnets of both high relative density and high magnetic properties. Magnetization tests showed a significant correlation between the shape of the demagnetization curve and the layer height. While small layer heights are beneficial for sufficient magnetic properties, the remaining main parameters tend to affect the magnetic properties less.

R-SPS transformed the Ni–P metastable alloys into bulk submicrometer grain-sized MMCs with Ni as the matrix and Ni3P as the reinforcement. Mechanical and magnetic properties of the four MMC samples were found to be closely related to the grain size of the Ni matrix, which varied from 247 to 638 nm. Yield stress, maximum stress, and coercive field increased when the grain size decreased, while plastic strain and magnetization saturation decreased.

In this work, the AC soft magnetic properties are investigated for FeCoNixCuAl (1.0 ≤ x ≤ 1.75) HEAs. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) show that the alloy consists of two phases, namely a face-centred cubic (FCC) phase and a body-centred cubic (BCC) phase. With increasing Ni content, the FCC phase content increased. Further research shows that the AC soft magnetic properties of these alloys are closely related to their phase constitution. Increasing the FCC phase content contributes to a decrease in the values of AC remanence (AC Br), AC coercivity (AC Hc) and AC total loss (Ps), while it is harmful to the AC maximum magnetic flux density (AC Bm). Ps can be divided into two parts: AC hysteresis loss (Ph) and eddy current loss (Pe). With increasing frequency f, the ratio of Ph/Ps decreases for all samples. When f ≤ 150 Hz, Ph/Ps &gt; 70%, which means that Ph mainly contributes to Ps. When f ≥ 800 Hz, Ph/Ps &lt; 40% (except for the x = 1.0 sample), which means that Pe mainly contributes to Ps.

However, their hyperthermia performance is often insufficient, which is considered as the main challenge to the development of practicable cancer treatments. In particular, ferrite MNPs have unique properties, such as a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy, high coercivity, and moderate saturation magnetization, however their hyperthermia performance needs to be further improved. In this study, cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) and zinc cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (ZnCoFe2O4) were prepared to achieve high SLP values by modifying the conventional co-precipitation method. Our modified method, which allows for precursor material compositions (molar ratio of Fe+3:Fe+2:Co+2/Zn+2 of 3:2:1), is a simple, environmentally friendly, and low temperature process carried out in air at a maximum temperature of 60 °C, without the need for oxidizing or coating agents. The particles produced were characterized using multiple techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis spectroscopy), and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). SLP values of the prepared nanoparticles were carefully evaluated as a function of time, magnetic field strength (30, 40, and 50 kA m−1), and the viscosity of the medium (water and glycerol), and compared to commercial magnetic nanoparticle materials under the same conditions. The cytotoxicity of the prepared nanoparticles by in vitro culture with NIH-3T3 fibroblasts exhibited good cytocompatibility up to 0.5 mg/mL. The safety limit of magnetic field parameters for SLP was tested. It did not exceed the 5 × 109 Am−1 s−1 threshold. A saturation temperature of 45 °C could be achieved. These nanoparticles, with minimal metal content, can ideally be used for in vivo hyperthermia applications, such as cancer treatments.</jats:p>"

Different annealing profiles have enabled remarkable changes in coercivity and magnetostriction values of Co-based amorphous microwires with initially negative magnitude, allowing induced magnetic bistability in stress-annealed samples and, consequently, high DW velocity has been observed. Similarly, Co-based nanocrystalline microwires with positive magnetostriction and spontaneous bistability have featured high DW velocity. Different values of tensile stresses applied during annealing have resulted in a redistribution of magnetoelastic anisotropy showing a decreasing trend in both DW velocities and coercivity of nanocrystalline samples.

For comparison, single-layered BNF and BST were also prepared on the same substrates, respectively. The results show that the dielectric loses suppression in BST/BNF/BST trilayered thin films at room temperature but has enhanced ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties.

We considered that the bismuth’s volatilization was limited by BST bottom layers making the Bi/Fe in good station, and the action of BST layer in the charge transfer between BNF thin film and electrode led to the quite low leakage current and enhanced multiferroic property. The origin of the mechanism of the highly enhanced dielectric constant and decreased loss tanδ was discussed.</jats:p>"

The L-PBF process parameters were optimized for the material, using a design of experiments approach. The printed samples were exposed to different heat treatment cycles to improve the magnetic properties. The magnetic properties were measured with quasi-static direct current and alternating current measurements at different frequencies and magnetic flux densities.

<jats:p>The optimized L-PBF process parameters resulted in very low porosity. The magnetic properties improved greatly after the heat treatments because of changes in microstructure. Based on the quasi-static DC measurement results, one of the heat treatment cycles led to magnetic saturation, permeability and coercivity values comparable to a commercial Fe-Co-V alloy. The other heat treatments resulted in abnormal grain growth and poor magnetic performance. The AC measurement results showed that the magnetic losses were relatively high in the samples owing to formation of eddy currents.</jats:p>

The sintering of the Fe-0 wt.% P sample was interrupted by the ferrite-austenite transformation at 912 °C due to the low diffusion rate of the austenite. The addition of P can stabilize the ferrite, and suppress the ferrite-austenite transformation. Therefore, all the P-containing samples shrank continuously throughout the whole sintering process, which showed improved sintering densities compared to the P-free sample. However, the sintering density did not increase monotonously with increasing P content. The Fe-1.4 wt.% P and Fe-1.6wt.% P samples easily got oxidized during sintering, and the densification process was thus influenced by the P-containing oxide particles.

It has been shown that the electrodeposition potential applied during the synthesis process determines the magnetic characteristics of FeCoNi films. The more negative potential is applied, the higher Ni content is in the FeCoNi alloy. At the same time, Co and Fe showed almost similar trend in which the content decreased with an increase in applied potential. The mean crystallite size of FeCoNi films was ranging from 11 nm to 15 nm. VSM evaluation indicated that the FeCoNi film is a ferromagnetic alloy with magnetic anisotropy.

The film produced with the Fe/Si thickness ratio of 3:1 shows relatively high structural quality.

24627,"<jats:p>This paper proposes a new method for producing nano-SrFe12O19 powder by the citrate precursor route using solid waste as a source of iron. This solid iron-containing waste, which exists in the form of an oily sludge, is produced by a cold rolling mill. This sludge was first subjected to a process, including sulfuric acid leaching, oxidation, precipitation, and nitric acid leaching, to obtain an iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3) solution. Next, the Fe(NO3)3 solution was mixed with a strontium nitrate (Sr(NO3)2) solution obtained by subjecting strontium carbonate to nitric acid leaching. Subsequently, citric acid, as chelating agent, and ammonia water, as precipitating agent, were added to the mixed solution to form a gel. The gel was dried and spontaneously combusted, then annealed at different temperatures for 2 h in flowing air. The effects of the Fe3+/Sr2+ molar ratio and annealing temperature on the formation, morphology, and magnetic properties of SrFe12O19 were investigated. The results showed that single-phase SrFe12O19 powder was obtained by decreasing the Fe3+/Sr2+ molar ratio from the stoichiometric value of 12 to 11.6 and increasing the annealing temperature to 1000 °C for 2 h. Adjustment of the Fe/Sr molar ratio to 12 and the annealing temperature to 900 °C enabled the magnetic properties to be optimized, including saturation magnetization (Ms) 80.2 emu/g, remanence magnetization (Mr) 39.8 emu/g, and coercive force (Hc) 6318 Oe.</jats:p>"

<jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Oblique angle deposition is known for yielding the growth of columnar grains that are tilted in the direction of the deposition flux. Using this technique combined with high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) can induce unique properties in ferromagnetic thin films. Earlier we have explored the properties of polycrystalline and epitaxially deposited permalloy thin films deposited under 35° tilt using HiPIMS and compared it with films deposited by dc magnetron sputtering (dcMS). The films prepared by HiPIMS present lower anisotropy and coercivity fields than films deposited with dcMS. For the epitaxial films dcMS deposition gives biaxial anisotropy while HiPIMS deposition gives a well-defined uniaxial anisotropy.</jats:p>
<jats:p>
<jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We report on the deposition of 50 nm polycrystalline nickel thin films by dcMS and HiPIMS while the tilt angle with respect to the substrate normal is varied from 0° to 70°. The HiPIMS-deposited films are always denser, with a smoother surface and are magnetically softer than the dcMS-deposited films under the same deposition conditions. The obliquely deposited HiPIMS films are significantly more uniform in terms of thickness. Cross-sectional SEM images reveal that the dcMS-deposited film under 70° tilt angle consists of well-defined inclined nanocolumnar grains while grains of HiPIMS-deposited films are smaller and less tilted. Both deposition methods result in in-plane isotropic magnetic behavior at small tilt angles while larger tilt angles result in uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The transition tilt angle varies with deposition method and is measured around 35° for dcMS and 60° for HiPIMS.</jats:p>
<jats:p>
<jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Due to the high discharge current and high ionized flux fraction, the HiPIMS process can suppress the inclined columnar growth induced by oblique angle deposition. Thus, the ferromagnetic thin films obliquely deposited by HiPIMS deposition exhibit different magnetic properties than dcMS-deposited films. The results demonstrate the potential of the HiPIMS process to tailor the material properties for some important technological applications in addition to the ability to fill high aspect ratio trenches and coating on cutting tools with complex geometries.</jats:p>"

24661,"<jats:p>The magnetic properties of the recycled hydrogenation disproportionation desorption recombination (HDDR) Nd-Fe-B powder, doped with a low weight fraction of DyF3 nanoparticles, were investigated. Spark plasma sintering (SPS) was used to consolidate the recycled Nd-Fe-B powder blends containing 1, 2, and 5 wt.% of DyF3 grounded powder. Different post-SPS sintering thermal treatment conditions (600, 750, and 900 °C), for a varying amount of time, were studied in view of optimizing the magnetic properties and developing characteristic core-shell microstructure in the HDDR powder. As received, recycled HDDR powder has coercivity (HCi) of 830 kA/m, and as optimally as SPS magnets reach 1160 kA/m, after the thermal treatment. With only 1–2 wt.% blended DyF3, the HCi peaked to 1407 kA/m with the thermal treatment at 750 °C for 1 h. The obtained HCi values of the blend magnet is ~69.5% higher than the starting recycled HDDR powder and 17.5% higher than the SPS processed magnet annealed at 750 °C for 1 h. Prolonging the thermal treatment time to 6 h and temperature conditions above 900 °C was detrimental to the magnetic properties. About ~2 wt.% DyF3 dopant was suitable to develop a uniform core-shell microstructure in the HDDR Nd-Fe-B powder. The Nd-rich phase in the HDDR powder has a slightly different and fluorine rich composition i.e., Nd-O-F2 than in the one reported in sintered magnets (Nd-O-F). The composition of reaction zone-phases after the thermal treatment and Dy diffusion was DyF4, which is more abundant in 5 wt.% doped samples. Further doping above 2 wt.% DyF3 is ineffective in augmenting the coercivity of the recycled HDDR powder, due to the decomposition of the shell structure and formation of non-ferromagnetic rare earth-based complex intermetallic compounds. The DyF3 doping is a very effective single step route in a controlled coercivity improvement of the recycled HDDR Nd-Fe-B powder from the end of life magnetic products.</jats:p>"

The structural, nano/microstructural, vibrational and magnetic properties of these samples have been studied as a function of calcination temperature (400 °C to 1100 °C). X-ray diffraction analysis of Fe doped ZnO powder has shown the major nanocrystalline wurtzite (ZnO) phase and the minor cubic spinel-like secondary nanocrystalline phase at 700 °C. At calcination temperature of 700 °C, the magnetization and coercivity have been enhanced in Fe doped ZnO. As the calcination temperature increased to 1100 °C, the major phase of ZnO and minor cubic spinel-like secondary phase turned into bulk in doped ZnO. Interestingly, the reduced magnetization and zero coercivity have been observed in this case. These changes are attributed to the conversion of secondary nanocrystalline ferromagnetic spinel phase to its bulk paramagnetic phase. The degree of inversion i.e. the occupancy of both sites with different symmetry by ferric ions is proposed to be solely responsible for the unusual behavior.</jats:p>"

The effects of growing magnetic oxide nanofilms in a 1 T field have been examined using various instrumental methods. It was found that the application of a magnetic field during PI MOCVD does not drastically alter the crystalline texture, surface morphology, and film thickness, but it significantly modifies the Fe3O4 film magnetisation and coercive field. Moreover, it was shown that the application of a 1 T field during the cooling of the sample also improves the magnetic properties. We believe that the large external field orients the magnetic spin structure at high temperatures (during growth or the initial stages of cool down) and that cooling through local magnetic ordering temperatures at Fe3O4 defect sites subsequently favours a ferromagnetic spin alignment. The control of magnetic properties of magnetite nanofilms by the application of magnetic fields during growth opens up new routes towards the fabrication and application of magnetic thin film devices.</jats:p>"

The coercivity and the amplitude of magnetic field strength of hysteresis loops can be captured with high accuracy based on this method. Then, a finite element model of the transformer core is constructed to predict the distributed magnetic flux density and the excitation current using the calculated hysteresis loops. The currents from various excitation voltages on two different transformer structures are also measured to compared with simulated currents. The outcome indicates that the overall hysteresis loops and magnetization curve of the transformer core may be useful for modeling the magnetic field and excitation current under any voltage excitation.</jats:p>"

<jats:p>The change in the dislocation density, induced by plastic deformation, influences strongly the magnetic domain structure inside the material. Being so, classic parameters, like the coercivity or magnetic permeability, can be a good measure of the deformation level, yet their reliable determination in a non-destructive way in industrial environment is problematic. The magnetoacoustic emission (MAE) which results from the non-180° domain walls (DW) movement in materials with non-zero magnetostriction can be used as an alternative. The intensity of the MAE signal changes strongly as a result of plastic deformation for both tensile and compressive deformation. It is however possible to discern those cases by analysing the changes in the shape of the MAE signal envelopes. The set of the martensitic steel samples (P91) deformed up to 10% (for both tension and compression) was investigated. Due to geometrical limitations imposed by the special mounting system, enabling compression without buckling, the sample had the shape resulting in low signal to noise (S/N) ratio. Being so the optimization of FFT filtering and wavelet analysis was performed in order to improve sensitivity of the proposed method of deformation level determination.</jats:p>"

Based on the physical interaction of the microstructure with the magnetic field, the micro-magnetic characterization allowed the analysis of changes of microstructure caused by wear, including phase transformation and development of residual stresses. Due to wide parameter variation and application of bandpass filter frequencies of micro-magnetic signals, it was possible to indicate and separate the main damage mechanisms considering the wear development. It could be shown that the maximum amplitude of BN correlates directly with the profile form deviation and increases with the progress of wear. Surface investigations via optical and scanning electron microscopy indicated strong surface fatigue wear with micro-pitting and micro-cracks, evident in cross-section after 3 × 105 cycles. The result of fatigue on the surface layer was the decrease of residual compression stresses, which was indicated by means of coercivity by BN-analysis. The different topographies of the surfaces, characterized via confocal white light microscopy, were also reflected in maximum BN-amplitude. Using complementary microscopic characterization in the cross-section, a strong correlation between micro-magnetic parameters and microstructure was confirmed and wear progress was characterized in dependence of depth under the wear surface. The phase transformation of retained austenite into martensite according to wear development, measured by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was also detected by micro-magnetic testing by IP-analysis.</jats:p>"
24720,"<jats:p>This paper investigates the effect of the ratio of ammonium nitrate (AN) on the structural, microstructural, magnetic, and alternating current (AC) conductivity properties of barium hexaferrite (BaFe12O19). The BaFe12O19 were prepared by using the salt melt method. The samples were synthesized using different powder-to-salt weight ratio variations (1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6 and 1:7) of BaCO3 + Fe2O3 and ammonium nitrate salt. The NH4NO3 was melted on a hot plate at 170 °C. A mixture of BaCO3 and Fe2O3 were added into the NH4NO3 melt solution and stirred for several hours using a magnetic stirrer under a controlled temperature of 170 °C. The heating temperature was then increased up to 260 °C for 24 hr to produce an ash powder. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) results show the intense peak of BaFe12O19 for all the samples and the presence of a small amount of the impurity Fe2O3 in the samples, at a ratio of 1:5 and 1:6. From the Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectra, the band appears at 542.71       cm   − 1       and 432.48       cm   − 1      , which corresponding to metal–oxygen bending and the vibration of the octahedral sites of BaFe12O19. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images show that the grains of the samples appear to stick each other and agglomerate at different masses throughout the image with the grain size 5.26, 5.88, 6.14, 6.22, and 6.18 µm for the ratios 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6, and 1:7 respectively. From the vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) analysis, the magnetic properties of the sample ratio at 1:3 show the highest value of coercivity Hc of 1317 Oe, a saturation magnetization Ms of 91 emu/g, and a remnant Mr of 44 emu/g, respectively. As the temperature rises, the AC conductivity is increases with an increase in frequency.</jats:p>"

The sizes of particles and the Ni content in NiO/Ni composites were controlled by tuning the laser parameters, such as laser fluence and irradiation time. We found that the weight fraction of Ni has a significant impact on magnetic properties of composite particles. Large exchange bias (HEB) and coercivity field (HC) were observed at 5 K due to the creation of heterojunctions at interfaces of ferromagnetic Ni and antiferromagnetic NiO. For the NiO/Ni composites with 80% of NiO we have observed the largest values of exchange bias (175 Oe) and coercive field (950 Oe), but the increase of Ni weight fraction resulted in the decrease of both HC and HEB values.</jats:p>"

The hysteresis curves showed the success in creating ferromagnetism with doping and the effect of sintering in the remanent magnetization and coercive field values, yet both systems were able to maintain its ferromagnetic behavior. The UV-vis analysis indicated the value of the band gap continued as a semiconductor material, although it has been narrowed.

Oxide powders of Fe2O3, Nd2O3, and Y2O3 were mixed in a stoichiometric ratio and milled for 5 h using high-energy ball milling, before being uniaxially pressed at 900 MPa and annealed at 1373 K for 2 h to obtain NdxY3−xFe5O12 (0 ≤ x ≤ 2.5). It was found that the mechanical milling of oxides followed by annealing promotes the complete structural formation of the garnet structure. Additionally, the X-ray diffraction patterns confirm the complete introduction of Nd3+ into the garnet structure with a neodymium doping concentration (x) of 0–2.0, which causes a consistent increment in the lattice parameters with the Nd3+ content. When x is higher than 2.0, the yttrium orthoferrite is the predominant phase. Besides, the magnetic results reveal an increase in the Curie temperature (583 K) as the amount of Nd3+ increases, while there was enhanced saturation magnetization as well as modified remanence and coercivity with respect to non-doped YIG.</jats:p>"

In this work, the minimum blocking temperature was lowered to 52 K for 4–5 nm α-Fe2O3 particles synthesized by femtosecond laser ablation of Fe in acetone. The effective magnetic anisotropy energy density (Keff) is calculated to be 2.7–5.4 × 105 J/m3, further extending the Keff values for smaller hematite particles synthesized by different methods. Large amorphous-Fe@α-Fe2O3 and amorphous-Fe@C particles of 10–100 nm in diameter display a soft magnetic behavior with saturation magnetization (Ms) and coercivities (Hc) values of 72.5 emu/g and 160 Oe at 5 K and 61.9 emu/g and 70 Oe at 300 K, respectively, which mainly stem from the magnetism of amorphous Fe cores. Generally, the nanoparticles obtained by LAL are either amorphous or polycrystalline, seldom in a single-crystalline state. This work also demonstrates the possibility of synthesizing single-crystalline α-Fe2O3 hematite crystals of several nanometers with (104), (113), (116) or (214) crystallographic orientations, which were produced simultaneously with other products including carbon encapsulated amorphous Fe (a-Fe@C) and Fe@FeOx core-shell particles by LAL in one step.

24765,"<jats:p>Fe-Cr-Co alloys precipitate nanosized α1 particles through spinodal decomposition, and their magnetic performance is susceptible to influence by the shape and arrangement of α1 particles. We studied spinodal decomposition during the heat treatment of Fe-Cr-Co alloys by both experimental and numerical simulation. Fe-Cr-Co alloys were fabricated first by directional solidification, followed by thermomagnetic treatment in a high magnetic field (HMF) and step aging. The experimental results show a spinodally decomposed structure consisting of nanosized α1 particles. The applied HMF caused the α1 phase to change into a rod-like shape. Moreover, a feather-like structure was observed near the grain boundary (GB), with slim α1 rods regularly arranged along the direction perpendicular to the GB. With the shape change and alignment of the α1 phase in the HMF, Fe-Cr-Co alloys show magnetic coercivity that is superior to those of samples without an HMF. To reveal the influence of HMF on phase transformations and the effect of GB, we conducted phase-field simulations of spinodal decomposition in the Fe-Cr-Co alloy. A migrating GB contributes to the elongation and arrangement of the α1 phase in the regions where the GB has passed. Thus, the α1 phase is arranged as parallel rods that are perpendicular to the GB. This GB effect consists of the effect of enhanced atomic mobility and the elastic energy. The α1 rods are elongated along the direction of HMF. The simulation results indicate that the feather-like structure is caused by a combined effect of both the GB and HMF. It is shown that the model generates microstructures which are qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally.</jats:p>"

In this work, we present a novel case study on the topotactic insertion of fluoride ions into oxygen-deficient ferromagnetic thin films of La0.74Sr0.26MnO3−δ (LSMO) epitaxially grown onto single-crystal SrTiO3 (STO) substrates. The effect of fluorination on the film structure, composition, and magnetic properties is compared with the case of oxygen-deficient and fully-oxidized LSMO films. Although incorporation of F− anions does not significantly alter the volume of the LSMO unit cell, a strong impact on the magnetic characteristics, including a remarkable suppression of Curie temperature and saturation magnetization accompanied by an increase in magnetic coercivity, was found. The change in magnetic properties can be ascribed to the disruption of the ferromagnetic exchange interactions along Mn-anion-Mn chains driven by F− doping into the LSMO lattice. Our results indicate that F− doping is a powerful means to effectively modify the magnetic functional properties of perovskite manganites.</jats:p>"

The refractive indexes of two layer films are well resolved by spectral ellipsometry demonstrating their good quality. Modelling data for three-layer films show considerable discrepancy with the experiment, which can be related to a stronger influence of interfaces. The magnetization processes of two-layer films weakly depend on the type and thickness of the upper non-ferromagnetic layers.

24877,"<jats:p>The magnetic properties of nanowires (NWs) and square nanorings, which were deposited by focused electron beam induced deposition (FEBID) of a Co carbonyl precursor, are studied using off-axis electron holography (EH), Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L-TEM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM). EH shows that NWs deposited using beam energies of 5 and 15 keV have the characteristics of magnetic dipoles, with larger magnetic moments observed for NWs deposited at lower energy. L-TEM is used to image magnetic domain walls in NWs and nanorings and their motion as a function of applied magnetic field. The NWs are found to have almost square hysteresis loops, with coercivities of ca. 10 mT. The nanorings show two different magnetization states: for low values of the applied in-plane field (0.02 T) a horseshoe state is observed using L-TEM, while for higher values of the applied in-plane field (0.3 T) an onion state is observed at remanence using L-TEM and MFM. Our results confirm the suitability of FEBID for nanofabrication of magnetic structures and demonstrate the versatility of TEM techniques for the study and manipulation of magnetic domain walls in nanostructures.</jats:p>"

The substituted Ba ferrite nanoparticles were fabricated by sol-gel process. Lattice parameter, particle size, magnetic properties, and reflection loss were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (X-RD), a Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), and a Network Analyzer. Lattice parameter of Ba ferrite was changed 0.0005 to 0.0078 Å in a-b direction, and 0.0187 to 0.0445 Å in c-direction by substituted elements, and it influenced on magnetic anisotropy. In addition, Co-Ti substitution elements influenced that coercive force decrease 5,739 to 2,240 Oe. Moreover, reflection loss frequencies were shifted from 16.3 GHz to 14.4 and 17.4 GHz by substituted elements Co-Ti and Zn-Ti.</jats:p>"

<jats:bold>Background:</jats:bold> Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) must not only be well-defined in composition, shape and size to exhibit the desired properties (e.g., exchange-bias for thermal stability of the magnetization) but also judiciously functionalized to ensure their stability in air and their compatibility with a polymer matrix, in order to avoid aggregation which may seriously affect their physical properties. Dipolar interactions between NPs too close to each other favour a collective magnetic glass state with lower magnetization and coercivity because of inhomogeneous and frustrated macrospin cluster freezing. Consequently, tailoring chemically (through surface functionalization) and magnetically stable NPs for technological applications is of primary importance.</jats:p>

We compared the influence of the synthesis parameters on the structural and microstructural properties of the resulting hybrid systems, with special emphasis on significantly reducing their mutual magnetic attraction. For this, we followed two routes: the first one consists of the direct grafting of bromopropionyl ester groups at the surface of the NPs, which were previously recovered and redispersed in a suitable solvent. The second route deals with an “all in solution” process, based on the decoration of NPs by oleic acid followed by ligand exchange with the desired bromopropionyl ester groups. We then built various assemblies of NPs directly on a substrate or suspended in PMMA.</jats:p>

Magnetic properties of the alloys were investigated using a hysteresis loop tracer and vibrating sample magnetometer. The annealed ribbons are composed of a two-phase nanostructure consisting of bcc Fe-based grains embedded in an amorphous matrix. Conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) measurements reveal a more advanced crystallization process in the surface layers when compared with the volume of the ribbons. The degree of saturation magnetization of the nanocrystalline alloys is of about 1.5 T. The coercive field varies from 1.0 to 6.5 A/m and peaks at an annealing temperature of 525°C. Magnetic softening of the nanocrystalline alloys observed after annealing at 550°C is correlated with a volume fraction of the nanocrystalline bcc phase.</jats:p>"

25182,"<jats:p>Magnetic recording media are composed of magnetic thin films consisting of magnetically isolated crystallites. For practical use of magnetic particles as recording media, it will be necessary to realize high coercivity by fabricating nanocrystalline grains and forming grain boundaries with the nonmagnetic phase. In this study, a high-coercivity FePt–Ag nanocomposite magnet was synthesized by means of block copolymer-templated self-assembly. Precursors of Fe, Pt, and Ag were introduced into a polymer block, and the resulting material was oxidized and then reduced to form a nanocomposite consisting of FePt nanoparticles surrounded by a matrix of Ag. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the introduction of Ag did not significantly affect the crystalline ordering of the FePt. The addition of Ag increased the coercivity by 53% (from 11.1 to 17.0 kOe). Our results suggest that the grain boundaries of the nonmagnetic Ag metal acted as pinning sites, disrupting magnetic coupling between individual FePt nanocrystallites and hindering domain wall motion at an external magnetic field.</jats:p>"

With NdFeB layer thickness increasing, both the grain size and the strain firstly reduce and then increase. When NdFeB layer thickness is 750 nm, the strain reaches the minimum value. Meanwhile, both the in-plane and perpendicular coercivities firstly drastically increase and then slowly decrease with NdFeB layer thickness increasing. The highest in-plane and perpendicular coercivities can be obtained at NdFeB layer thickness of 750 nm, which are 21.2 kOe and 19.5 kOe, respectively. In addition, the high remanence ratio (remanent magnetization/saturation magnetization) of 0.87 can also be achieved in Ta/Nd/NdFeB (750 nm)/Nd/Ta film.</jats:p>"

X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of a single phase with compact cubic spinel structure. The magnetic measurements show that the saturation magnetization and remanence of all samples increased with increasing iron concentration. The coercive field decreased up to the concentration x= 0.15, and above x= 0.25 it was observed an increase in the coercive field. Through electrical characterization it was found that the samples presented highly insulating behavior for x= 0.01, and further increase in x above 0.15 gives a semiconductor behavior compatible with the potential barrier between the crystallites model, i.e. fulfills the condition L/2 &gt; LD (crystallite size L in comparison with the Debye length LD), and the conduction is limited by potential barriers between the crystallites.</jats:p>"

Two phenomena have been discovered that are difficult to explain (1) that the hardness decreases with increasing laser energy and (2) that the coercivity decreases with decreasing laser energy.

25368,"<jats:p>Abstract. The bulk magnetic mineral record from Lake Ohrid, spanning the past 637 kyr, reflects large-scale shifts in hydrological conditions, and, superimposed, a strong signal of environmental conditions on glacial–interglacial and millennial timescales. A shift in the formation of early diagenetic ferrimagnetic iron sulfides to siderites is observed around 320 ka. This change is probably associated with variable availability of sulfide in the pore water. We propose that sulfate concentrations were significantly higher before  ∼  320 ka, due to either a higher sulfate flux or lower dilution of lake sulfate due to a smaller water volume. Diagenetic iron minerals appear more abundant during glacials, which are generally characterized by higher Fe / Ca ratios in the sediments.  While in the lower part of the core the ferrimagnetic sulfide signal overprints the primary detrital magnetic signal, the upper part of the core is dominated by variable proportions of high- to low-coercivity iron oxides. Glacial sediments are characterized by high concentration of high-coercivity magnetic minerals (hematite, goethite), which relate to enhanced erosion of soils that had formed during preceding interglacials. Superimposed on the glacial–interglacial behavior are millennial-scale oscillations in the magnetic mineral composition that parallel variations in summer insolation. Like the processes on glacial–interglacial timescales, low summer insolation and a retreat in vegetation resulted in enhanced erosion of soil material. Our study highlights that rock-magnetic studies, in concert with geochemical and sedimentological investigations, provide a multi-level contribution to environmental reconstructions, since the magnetic properties can mirror both environmental conditions on land and intra-lake processes.

In this work, ordered arrays of Co/Cu multilayered nanowires which can be exploited to develop magnetoresistive sensors were successfully prepared using porous anodic alumina (PAA) templates. The structure and morphology of the multilayered nanowire arrays were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The nanowire arrays are highly ordered and the average diameter is about 50 nm, which is controlled by the pore diameter of the PAA templates. The influences of period number and Cu layer thickness on the magnetic and the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) properties were investigated. The coercivity and remanence ratio increase first and then gradually tend to be stable with the increase of period number and the Cu layer thickness, while the GMR ratio increases first and then decreases with the increase of the period number accompanied by an oscillatory behavior of GMR as the Cu layer thickness changes, which are ascribed to the spin dependence electron scattering in the multilayers. The optimum GMR of −13% appears at Co (50 nm)/Cu (5 nm) with 200 deposition cycles in our experimental conditions.</jats:p>"

25471,"<jats:p>Abstract. The bulk magnetic mineral record from Lake Ohrid, spanning the past ca. 640 ka, shows a strong relationship to environmental conditions on glacial–interglacial and millennial time scales. During extremely cold glacials, a lower accumulation of organic matter and likely enhanced mixing of the water-column coincides with the presence of greigite, whereas greigite is absent in sediments deposited during less severe glacials. Those ""non-greigite"" glacial sediments are characterized by high concentration of high-coercivity magnetic minerals, which relates to enhanced erosion of soils that had formed during the preceding interglacials. In contrast, magnetite dominated magnetic mineral assemblages characterize interglacial deposits and most likely originate from detrital particles of physically weathered rocks. Superimposed on the glacial–interglacial behavior are millennial scale oscillations in the magnetic mineral composition that parallel variations in summer insolation. Likewise to the process on glacial–interglacial time-scales, low summer insolation and a retreat in vegetation resulted in enhanced erosion of soil material. Our study highlights that rock-magnetic studies, in concert with geochemical and sedimentological investigations, provide a multi-level contribution to environmental reconstructions, since the magnetic properties can mirror both, environmental conditions on land and intra-lacustrine processes.

Relevant magnetic characteristics, reflecting the ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe clusters and the Cr matrix, i.e., blocking temperature, coercivity field, and exchange bias were measured and their dependence on cluster size and cluster concentration in the matrix was analyzed. It is evident that the blocking temperatures are clearly affected by both the cluster size and their concentration in the Cr matrix. In contrast the coercivity shows hardly any dependence on size or inter-cluster distance. The exchange bias was found to be strongly sensitive to the cluster size but not to the inter-cluster distances.

Las membranas de alúmina auto-ensambladas se sintetizaron por anodizado en dos pasos, usando una celda electroquímica y potencial eléctrico constante. Se variaron los diámetros de poro entre 20 nm y 40 nm (no así la distancia media entre ellos) sumergiendo las membranas en ácido fosfórico al 5% durante distintos tiempos. Estas membranas se caracterizaron por microscopía de barrido (SEM). Los nanohilos de Ni se obtuvieron por electrodeposición AC, a 20 V, 200 Hz y temperatura ambiente. Una vez sintetizados, los arreglos de nanohilos se caracterizaron estructuralmente por SEM y magnéticamente usando un SQUID. Se observa que las propiedades magnéticas de los arreglos son fuertemente dependientes de la relación largo/diámetro de los nanohilos, la que regula el valor de su anisotropía de forma, y también de la porosidad, que determina la magnitud del campo de interacción dipolar que percibe cada nanohilo por la presencia de sus vecinos en el arreglo.

As annealing proceeded, the precipitates lost coherency to the matrix after reaching a size of 15–20 nm and twin-like structures were consecutively introduced in the particles. The SQUID measurements revealed that the magnetic properties of the specimens correlated with the microstructural evolution.

25610,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plasmonic devices, made of apertures or antennas, have played significant roles in advancing the fields of optics and opto-electronics by offering subwavelength manipulation of light in the visible and near infrared frequencies. The development of heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) opens up a new application of plasmonic nanostructures, where they act as near field transducers (NFTs) to locally and temporally heat a sub-diffraction-limited region in the recording medium above its Curie temperature to reduce the magnetic coercivity. This allows use of very small grain volume in the medium while still maintaining data thermal stability, and increasing storage density in the next generation hard disk drives (HDDs). In this paper, we review different plasmonic NFT designs that are promising to be applied in HAMR. We focus on the mechanisms contributing to the coupling and confinement of optical energy. We also illustrate the self-heating issue in NFT materials associated with the generation of a confined optical spot, which could result in degradation of performance and failure of components. The possibility of using alternative plasmonic materials will be discussed.</jats:p>"

Due to the ability of the <sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer spectroscopic technique to probe the environment of the Fe nuclei, a valuable insight on a local atomic scale into the mechanically induced changes in the hexagonal structure of the material is obtained. It is revealed that the milling of BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> results in the deformation of its constituent polyhedra (FeO<sub>6</sub> octahedra, FeO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra and FeO<sub>5</sub> triangular bi-pyramids) as well as in the mechanically triggered transition of the Fe<sup>3+</sup> cations from the regular 12k octahedral sites into the interstitial positions provided by the magnetoplumbite structure. The response of the hexaferrite to the mechanical treatment is found to be accompanied by the formation of a non-uniform nanostructure consisting of an ordered crystallite surrounded/separated by a structurally disordered surface shell/interface region. The distorted polyhedra and the non-equilibrium cation distribution are found to be confined to the amorphous near-surface layers of the ferrite nanoparticles with the thickness extending up to about 2 nm. The information on the mechanically induced short-range structural disorder in BaFe<sub>12</sub>O<sub>19</sub> is complemented by an investigation of its magnetic behaviour on a macroscopic scale. It is demonstrated that the milled ferrite nanoparticles exhibit a pure superparamagnetism at room temperature.

The out-of-plane coercivity field was modulated as a function of the FePt thickness because of the interface coupling attenuation between Fe and FePtAg. The coercivity was inversely proportional to the FePt thickness as evidenced by the pinning effect at the stepwise interface. Additionally, the out-of-plane magnetization was controlled by domain wall pinning effect.

Below a critical grain size of the used CoCrPt exchange-decoupled granular films the information cannot be stored for a reasonable time (typically ten years) due to thermal fluctuations arbitrary flipping of the magnetization direction. An alternative approach that may provide higher storage densities is the use of so-called percolated media, in which defect structures are imprinted in an exchange-coupled magnetic film. Such percolated magnetic films are investigated in the present work. We employ preparation routes that are based on (i) self-assembly of Au nanoparticles and (ii) homogeneous size-reduction of self-assembled polystyrene particles. On such non-close-packed nanostructures thin Fe films or Co/Pt multilayers are grown with in-plane and out-of-plane easy axis of magnetization. The impact of the particles on the magnetic switching behavior is measured by both integral magnetometry and magnetic microscopy techniques. We observe enhanced coercive fields while the switching field distribution is broadened compared to thin-film reference samples. It appears possible to tailor the magnetic domain sizes down to the width of an unperturbed domain wall in a continuous film, and moreover, we observe pinning and nucleation at or close to the imprinted defect structures.</jats:p>"

Carbon-containing nickel nanowires are first grown on a nanograted surface by magnetron sputtering. Then, a post-annealing treatment favors the metal-catalyzed crystallization of carbon into stacked graphene layers rolled around the nickel cores. The observed uniaxial magnetic anisotropy field oriented along the nanowire axis is an indication that the shape anisotropy dominates the dipolar coupling between the wires. We further show that the thermal treatment induces a decrease in the coercivity of the nanowire arrays. This reflects an enhancement of the quality of the nickel nanowires after annealing attributed to a decrease of the roughness of the nickel surface and to a reduction of the defect density. This new type of graphene–ferromagnetic-metal nanowire appears to be an interesting building block for spintronic applications.</jats:p>"

The samples were then annealed at successively higher temperatures under a H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> atmosphere, and the resulting variations of their structure, morphology and magnetic properties were characterized. We observed pronounced differences in the diffusion and alloying of Co nanoparticles on Pt films with different orientations and microstructures. On textured Pt(111) films exhibiting grain sizes (20–30 nm) smaller than the particle spacing (100 nm), the formation of local nanoalloys at the surface is strongly suppressed and Co incorporation into the film via grain boundaries is favoured. In contrast, due to the absence of grain boundaries on high quality epitaxial Pt(100) films with micron-sized grains, local alloying at the film surface was established. Signatures of alloy formation were evident from magnetic investigations. Upon annealing to temperatures up to 380 °C, we found an increase both of the coercive field and of the Co orbital magnetic moment, indicating the formation of a CoPt phase with strongly increased magnetic anisotropy compared to pure Co. At higher temperatures, however, the Co atoms diffuse into a nearby surface region where Pt-rich compounds are formed, as shown by element-specific microscopy.</jats:p>"

Morphological, structural, spectroscopic and magnetic characterization of the product were done by SEM, TEM, XRD, and VSM, respectively. The average crystallite size (on the base of line profile fitting method), D and σ, is estimated as 30 ± 6 nm. Some anomalous magnetic properties and their enhanced effect have been observed in Co3O4 antiferromagnetic nanocrystallites, including a bias field, coercivity, permanent magnetic moments and an open loop. These phenomena are attributed to the unidirectional anisotropy which is caused by the exchange coupling between AFM and FM layers, the existence of the spin glass like surface spins of Co3O4 nanoparticles due to size effects and surface-area effect.</jats:p>"

In the present work, a novel variant of synthesis of ordered magnetic nanowires in the mesoporous silica matrix was suggested. The method is based on incorporation of a hydrophobic metal compound Co<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>(CO)<jats:sub>8</jats:sub> into the hydrophobic part of the silica-surfactant composite. The amount of cobalt intercalated into the mesoporous matrix was measured by chemical analysis (~5 wt %). Additional thermal modification was performed in order to provide a crystallization process of the cobalt nanowires. The prepared nanocomposites were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), small-angle X-ray spectroscopy (SAXS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nitrogen capillary adsorption method (BET and BJH), and magnetic measurements. The anisotropy parameters of nanowires were determined using temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility. For cobalt-containing sample annealed at 300 °C (form factor of nanowire higher than 16), the coercive force at room temperature was found to be 42.2 kA/m at saturation magnetization of 0.5 A.m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/kg, which is nearly sufficient for modern information recording media. According to TEM studies, cobalt particles are uniform and well ordered in the silica matrix. Thus, the suggested method leads to one-dimensional anisotropic nanostructures, which could find an application in high-density data storage devices.</jats:p>"

An extensive study has been made of the magnetic properties of
LaMnO3+δ with finely tuned hole
concentrations, x (=2δ), ranging between
0·08 and 0·15. As x increases in the range
studied, the spontaneous magnetisation at low temperature increases from only
about 20% to almost 100% of the value for full polarisation of
Mn spins, and the coercivity Hc
decreases by more than an order of magnitude, e.g. from 4·2 kOe to 120
Oe at 5 K. The magnetic ordering temperature
Tc takes a minimum at
x =
xc ~ 0·12. For
x &lt; xc,
the inverse susceptibility shows a marked decrease as
Tc is approached from above.
Measurements of minor hysteresis loops for the sample with
x = 0·08 show that magnetisation is
reversible with respect to field changes except near
Hc. These observations are
discussed in terms of a two-phase exchange coupling (TPEC) model in which it
is assumed that at low temperature the system separates into two phases, a
hole-free antiferromagnetic phase and an optimally doped ferromagnetic phase,
and the two phases are coupled through superexchange interactions at the
interface.</jats:p>"

Static force measurements were made for various air gap settings and bearing current combinations. The resulting data was reduced and an optimized expression representing the force versus current and air gap relationship of the actuator was found. In addition, a theoretical force model was developed using simple magnetic circuit theory and constant material magnetic properties. The theoretical model predicted force magnitudes approximately 20 percent greater than the experimentally measured values. Hysteresis tests were conducted with the thrust disk in the centered position for various current perturbation amplitudes about the design bias current. Hysteresis effects were shown to cause a difference between the measured force as the current was increasing as compared to when the current was decreasing. This difference varied from 10% to 7% of the peak force from each respective hysteresis loop. A second order polynomial expression was developed to express the coercive force as a function of the perturbation current amplitude. The bearing frequency response was examined by injecting sinusoidal currents of varying frequencies into the bearing. An actuator bandwidth of at least 700 Hz was determined. Above 700 Hz the bearing frequency response could not be distinguished from the test fixture frequency response.</jats:p>"

This can be a significant indicator of machine problems. Additionally, magnetic bearings can be utilized as a load cell for measuring impeller forces in test rigs. The forces supported by magnetic bearings are directly related to the currents, air gaps and other parameters in the bearings.

For design current loops, 0.95 A to 2.55 A, at the time rate of change of 0.1 A/sec, the difference between increasing and decreasing current curves due to hysteresis ranged from 4% to 8%. If the bearing is operated in small trajectories about a fixed (non-zero) operation point on the F/I (force/current) curve, the scatter in the measurement error could be expected to be on the order of 4 percent.</jats:p>

The pulse size distributions show a strong dependence on this parameter. The number of the Barkhausen-pulses increases with decreasing grain size. The comparison of the spectra measured at an external field in the vicinity of the coercive force with those measured at a field where domain rotation begins shows that in the latter region the size and number of jumps is larger. Measurements of the counting rate of the Barkhausen jumps versus the external magnetic field show two maxima instead of normally one at the coercive force. This unusual behaviour could be explained with the successive change of Bloch wall types in certain sections of the hysteresis loop and their different interaction with dislocations.</jats:p>"

26634,"<jats:p>CoSb3-based skutterudite alloy is one of the most promising thermoelectric materials in the middle temperature range (room temperature—550 °C). However, the realization of an appropriate metallization layer directly on the sintered skutterudite pellet is indispensable for the real thermoelectric generation application. Here, we report an approach to prepare the metallization layer and the subsequent diffusion bonding method for the high-performance multi-filled n-type skutterudite alloys. Using the electroplating followed by low-temperature annealing approaches, we successfully fabricated a Co-Mo metallization layer on the surface of the skutterudite alloy. The coefficient of thermal expansion of the electroplated layer was optimized by changing its chemical composition, which can be controlled by the electroplating temperature, current and the concentration of the Mo ions in the solution. We then joined the metallized skutterudite leg to the Cu-Mo electrode using a diffusion bonding method performed at 600 °C and 1 MPa for 10 min. The Co-Mo/skutterudite interfaces exhibit extremely low specific contact resistivity of 1.41 μΩ cm2. The metallization layer inhibited the elemental inter-diffusion to less than 11 µm after annealing at 550 °C for 60 h, indicating a good thermal stability.

The approach involves the addition of metallic Co, acting as a pore filler on oxidation, and considers two simple sintering schemes. The (1-x)Ca3Co4O9/xCo composites (x = 0%, 3%, 6% and 9% vol.) have been prepared through a modified Pechini method, followed by one- and two-stage sintering, to produce low-density (one-stage, 1ST) and high-density (two-stage, 2ST) ceramic samples. Their high-temperature TE properties, namely the electrical conductivity (σ), Seebeck coefficient (α) and power factor (PF), were investigated between 475 and 975 K, in air flow, and related to their respective phase composition, morphology and microstructure. For the 1ST case, the porous samples (56%–61% of ρth) reached maximum PF values of around 210 and 140 μWm−1·K−2 for the 3% and 6% vol. Co-added samples, respectively, being around two and 1.3 times higher than those of the pure Ca3Co4O9 matrix. Although 2ST sintering resulted in rather dense samples (80% of ρth), the efficiency of the proposed approach, in this case, was limited by the complex phase composition of the corresponding ceramics, impeding the electronic transport and resulting in an electrical performance below that measured for the Ca3Co4O9 matrix (224 μWm−1·K−2 at 975K).</jats:p>"

The results showed that the mortars with 5 mol/dm3 of NaOH and 100 g of Na2SiO3 (N5-S22) gave a greater compressive strength than other mixes. The compressive strengths of analyzed fly ash mortars with activators N5-S22 and N5-C10 (5 mol/dm3 NaOH and 10% CaO) varied from 14.3 MPa to 5.9 MPa.

It was found that the skutterudite phase nucleated directly from the under-cooled melt and grew into submicron dendrites during the melt-spinning process. Upon heating, the spun ribbons started to form nanoscale La-rich and La-poor skutterudite phases through spinodal decomposition at temperatures as low as 473 K. The coexistence of the micron-scale grain size, the submicron-scale dendrite segregation and the nanoscale spinodal decomposition leads to high thermoelectric performance and mechanical strength.

In addition, the intensities of electron diffraction suffer from dynamical scattering. Recently, a new electron diffraction method, rotation electron diffraction (RED), was developed, which can overcome the drawbacks and reduce dynamical effects.

26959,"<jats:p>This paper presents an energetically autonomous IoT sensor powered via thermoelectric harvesting. The operation of thermal harvesting is based on maintaining a temperature gradient of at least 26.31 K between the thermoelectric-generator sides. While the hot side employs a metal plate, the cold side is attached with a phase-change material acting as an effective passive dissipative material. The desired temperature gradient allows claiming power conversion efficiencies of about 26.43%, without efficiency reductions associated with heating and soiling. This work presents the characterization of a low-cost off-the-shelf thermoelectric generator that allows estimating the production of at least 407.3 mW corresponding to 2.44 Wh of available energy considering specific operation hours—determined statistically for a given geographic location. Then, the energy production is experimentally verified with the construction of an outdoor IoT sensor powered by a passively-cooled thermoelectric generator. The prototype contains a low-power microcontroller, environmental sensors, and a low-power radio to report selected environmental variables to a central node. This work shows that the proposed supply mechanism provides sufficient energy for continuous operation even during times with no solar resource through an on-board Li-Po battery. Such a battery can be recharged once the solar radiation is available without compromising sensor operation.</jats:p>"

The effects of leg geometry, material, segmentation, and two-stage arrangement on maximum power, maximum efficiency, and maximum stress under various temperature differences and voltage load conditions were investigated. The performance parameters of the thermoelectric module were evaluated based on a numerical approach using ANSYS 19.1 commercial software. An analytical approach based on theoretical equations of the thermoelectric module was used to verify the accuracy and reliability of the numerical approach. The numerically predicted values for maximum power and maximum efficiency of the thermoelectric module were validated as ±5% and those for the maximum thermal stress of the thermoelectric module as ±7% with the corresponding calculated theoretical values. In addition, the predicted values of maximum power and maximum stress of the thermoelectric module were validated as ±2% and ±5%, respectively, with studies reported by Ma et al. and Al-Merbati et al. Of all the combinations, the single stage segmented arrangement with cylindrical leg geometry and SiGe+Bi2Te3 material was suggested as the best combination with maximum power of 0.73 W, maximum efficiency of 13.2%, and maximum thermal stress of 0.694 GPa.</jats:p>"

27016,"<jats:p>Developing new thermoelectric materials with high performance can broaden the thermoelectric family and is the key to fulfill extreme condition applications. In this work, we proposed two new high-temperature thermoelectric materials—MgV2O5 and CaV2O5—which are derived from the interface engineered V2O5. The electronic and thermoelectric properties of V2O5, MgV2O5, and CaV2O5 were calculated based on first principles and Boltzmann semi-classical transport equations. It was found that although V2O5 possessed a large Seebeck coefficient, its large band gap strongly limited the electrical conductivity, hence hindering it from being good thermoelectric material. With the intercalation of Mg and Ca atoms into the van der Waals interfaces of V2O5, i.e., forming MgV2O5 and CaV2O5, the electronic band gaps could be dramatically reduced down to below 0.1 eV, which is beneficial for electrical conductivity. In MgV2O5 and CaV2O5, the Seebeck coefficient was not largely affected compared to V2O5. Consequently, the thermoelectric figure of merit was expected to be improved noticeably. Moreover, the intercalation of Mg and Ca atoms into the V2O5 van der Waals interfaces enhanced the anisotropic transport and thus provided a possible way for further engineering of their thermoelectric performance by nanostructuring. Our work provided theoretical guidelines for the improvement of thermoelectric performance in layered oxide materials.</jats:p>"

The crystal structure of these compounds belongs to the tetragonal P4/nmm space group (No. 129) at room temperature. The lattice parameter c decreases with increasing x, while a remains almost unchanged among the samples. Despite isovalent substitution of As for Sb, electrical resistivity significantly rises with increasing x. Very low thermal conductivity of less than 0.8 Wm−1K−1 is observed at temperatures between 300 and 673 K for all the examined samples. For As-doped samples, the thermal conductivity further decreases above 600 K.

A rapid, highly scalable, and process-temperature-sensitive solution synthesis route is demonstrated for the fabrication of thermoelectric (TE) Cu2−xSe. The process relies on readily available precursors and microwave-assisted thermolysis, which is sensitive to reaction conditions; yielding Cu1.8Se at 200 °C and Cu2Se at 250 °C within 6–8 min reaction time. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed crystalline nature of as-made particles with irregular truncated morphology, which exhibit a high phase purity as identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) analysis. Temperature-dependent transport properties were characterized via electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal diffusivity measurements. Subsequent to spark plasma sintering, pure Cu1.8Se exhibited highly compacted and oriented grains that were similar in size in comparison to Cu2Se, which led to its high electrical and low thermal conductivity, reaching a very high power-factor (24 µW/K−2cm−1). Density-of-states (DOS) calculations confirm the observed trends in electronic properties of the material, where Cu-deficient phase exhibits metallic character. The TE figure of merit (ZT) was estimated for the materials, demonstrating an unprecedentedly high ZT at 875 K of 2.1 for Cu1.8Se sample, followed by 1.9 for Cu2Se.

Solution-based inkjet printing of metal oxide semiconductor usually requires a heat treatment step to facilitate the formation of target material. The employment of external furnace introduces additional complexity in the fabrication scheme, which is supposed to be simplified by the additive manufacturing process. This work presents the fabrication and utilization of micro-heater on the same thermal resistive substrate with the printed precursor pattern to facilitate the formation of zinc oxide (ZnO) semiconductor. The ultraviolet (UV) photodetector fabricated by the proposed scheme was successfully demonstrated. The performance characterization of the printed devices shows that increasing input heating power can effectively improve the electrical properties owing to a better formation of ZnO. The proposed approach using the on-substrate heating element could be useful for the additive manufacturing of functional material by eliminating the necessity of external heating equipment, and it allows in-situ annealing for the printed semiconductor. Hence, the integration of the printed electronic device with printing processes of other materials could be made possible.</jats:p>"

Along with these ashes, silica fume and rice husk ash are also considered for the stabilization of fly ash based on their amorphous silica content with the aim to convert them into an inert material. The characterization of all the investigated ashes was performed using different techniques: X-ray diffraction, total reflection X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The aim of this work is to describe the reuse possibilities that were proposed for these ashes, which were determined also on the basis of their structural properties. Several possible applications of the investigated ashes are proposed, and the most suitable reuse of stabilized fly ash samples seems to be the production of sustainable plastic composites.

The relevance of the material lies in its potential thermoelectric properties: in analogy with similar skutterudites systems, these features should in fact result as being improved with respect to the ones of the corresponding Sn-free system thanks to the partial substitution of Sn for Sb, which is expected to lower the phonon thermal conductivity. The results of Rietveld refinements allowed us to study the skutterudite structural properties and to discuss them, adopting a comparative approach with respect to the ones of the Sn-free system Smy(FexNi1−x)4Sb12. Relying on the refined Sm occupancy factors, the p/n crossover is shown to be located at x ~ 0.53, meaning that the introduction of Sn induces an enlargement of the p-region; moreover, at variance with the Sn-free system, the coefficient of thermal expansion does not show any significant mismatch between n- and p-compositions, which should ensure a prolonged lifetime of a device made of n- and p-legs that both derive from the studied system.</jats:p>"

27086,"<jats:p>Organic materials have been found to be promising candidates for low-temperature thermoelectric applications. In particular, poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) has been attracting great interest due to its desirable intrinsic properties, such as excellent solution processability, chemical and thermal stability, and high field-effect mobility. However, its poor electrical conductivity has limited its application as a thermoelectric material. It is therefore important to improve the electrical conductivity of P3HT layers. In this work, we studied how molecular weight (MW) influences the thermoelectric properties of P3HT films. The films were doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl) imide salt (LiTFSI) and 4-tert butylpyridine (TBP). Various P3HT layers with different MWs ranging from 21 to 94 kDa were investigated. UV–Vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis were performed to investigate the morphology and structure features of thin films with different MWs. The electrical conductivity initially increased when the MW increased and then decreased at the highest MW, whereas the Seebeck coefficient had a trend of reducing as the MW grew. The maximum thermoelectric power factor (1.87 μW/mK2) was obtained for MW of 77 kDa at 333 K. At this temperature, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of this MW were 65.5 S/m and 169 μV/K, respectively.</jats:p>"

We have fabricated thermoelectric composite thick films using two different mesh sizes of n-type bismuth particles, various binder to thermoelectric material weight ratios, and two different pressures, 200 MPa and 300 MPa, in order to optimize the thermoelectric properties of the composite films. The use of chitosan dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide with less than 0.2 wt. % of chitosan, the first time chitosan has been used in this process, was sufficient for fabricating TE inks and composite films. Low temperature curing processes, along with uniaxial pressure, were used to evaporate the solvent from the drop-casted inks. This combination reduced the temperature needed compared to traditional curing processes while simultaneously increasing the packing density of the film by removing the pores and voids in the chitosan-bismuth composite film. Microstructural analysis of the composite films reveals low amounts of voids and pores when pressed at sufficiently high pressures. The highest performing composite film was obtained with the weight ratio of 1:2000 binder to bismuth, 100-mesh particle size, and 300 MPa of pressure. The best performing bismuth chitosan composite film that was pressed at 300 MPa had a power factor of 4009 ± 391 μW/m K2 with high electrical conductivity of 7337 ± 522 S/cm.

The origami-fin increases the stretchability of the TEG by bending a non-stretchable material into a folded shape, and it also works as a heat radiator because of its large surface area compared to that of a flat structure. We evaluated the heat radiation performance of the origami-fin and the stability of the performance when it was stretched.

27095,<jats:p>We study analytically and numerically the thermoelectric properties of a chain of cold atoms with dipole-dipole interactions placed in an optical periodic potential. At small potential amplitudes the chain slides freely that corresponds to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser phase of integrable curves of a symplectic map. Above a certain critical amplitude the chain is pinned by the lattice being in the cantori Aubry phase. We show that the Aubry phase is characterized by exceptional thermoelectric properties with the figure of merit     Z T = 25     being 10 times larger than the maximal value reached in material science experiments. We show that this system is well accessible for magneto-dipole cold atom experiments that opens new prospects for investigations of thermoelectricity.</jats:p>

27152,"<jats:p>For industrial applications, the scalability of a finalised design is an important factor to consider. The scaling process of typical membrane-type acoustic metamaterials may pose manufacturing challenges such as stress uniformity of the membrane and spatial consistency of the platelet. These challenges could be addressed by plate-type acoustic metamaterials with an internal tonraum resonator. By adopting the concept of modularity in a large-scale design (or meta-panel), the acoustical performance of different specimen configurations could be scaled and modularly combined. This study justifies the viability of two meta-panel configurations for low-frequency (80–500 Hz) noise control. The meta-panels were shown to be superior to two commercially available noise barriers at 80–500 Hz. This superiority was substantiated when the sound transmission class (STC) and the outdoor-indoor transmission class (OITC) were compared. The meta-panels were also shown to provide an average noise reduction of 22.7–27.4 dB at 80–400 Hz when evaluated in different noise environments—traffic noise, aircraft flyby noise, and construction noise. Consequently, the meta-panel may be further developed and optimised to obtain a design that is lightweight and yet has good acoustical performance at below 500 Hz, which is the frequency content of most problematic noises.</jats:p>"

Resultant materials exhibit a high crystallinity and phase purity, as characterized by XRD, and platelet morphology, as revealed by SEM. Surface chemistry of as-made materials showed a mixture of metallic and oxide phases, as evidenced by XPS. Zeta-potential analysis exhibited a systematic change of isoelectric point as a function of the material composition. As-made materials were directly sintered into pellets by using spark plasma sintering process.

A series of experiments was carried out by a scanning electron microscope, a differential scanning calorimeter, a hot-disk thermal analyzer, and leakage tests on the composite PCM with various mass fractions of EG and metals (i.e., Cu, Al, Ni, and Fe). Through comprehensive consideration of the thermal conductivity, leakage, and homogeneity, a composite PCM with the optimal proportion (PA-EG11%-Cu1.9%) was screened out. Its thermal conductivity was significantly improved nine times, while the phase change enthalpy showed a minimal decrease. In addition, the relationships of the composite PCM with its temperature and density were systematically investigated. The experimental results are important for determining the proper package density of PCM for application into a personal cooling system because its weight is crucial for the system design and benefits the performance comparison of various PCMs prepared under various conditions.

In this research various conditions of the coating process were examined. The effect of the atmosphere on the bonding and densification of the coating was studied using argon, vacuum and air. From the three air shows, the best bonding characteristics were from a better flow of glass and increased bonding between the oxidized PbTe layer and glass. This also created a PbO rich glass in the interface between the glass and the PbTe sample. The effect of 0, 3, and 6 wt. % NaCl additive to the solution was tested and showed that NaCl achieves better coverage due to high green body density, reaction of NaCl with the glass and removal of remaining CO2 from the glass in the form of decomposing Na2CO3. In addition, when testing the time and temperature, it was shown that the temperature of 520 °C was the minimum needed for high densification of the glass, but a duration shorter than 30 min did not allow for bonding of the glass to the substrate despite adequate densification.

27429,"<jats:p>Polyaniline (PANI) has been considered for thermoelectric (T.E) applications due to its facile preparation methods, easy doping-dedoping processes and its environmental stability. Like other conducting polymers (CPs), it has low thermal conductivity (usually below 1 Wm<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>K<jats:sup>-1</jats:sup>) which is favorable for T.E applications, however studies have shown that it still suffers from low power factors as a result of low electrical conductivity.

Microscopic and spectroscopic techniques accompanied by extensive thermal analysis have been chosen to provide useful information about local changes in surface structure and morphology. Moreover, pristine, percolating surface with inner-formed, metallic structures shows moderate conducting properties within exploited materials which unfortunately diminish after thermal healing stimulus is being applied. This statement is supported by observing the coverage of regional defects and nearby pores with a concise, uniform layer of blend having different PU:PCL ratio. Including the additional fact that apparent filler migration is changing local dopant composition brings up an assumption that both phenomena have negative synergy effect on each other. </jats:p>"

<jats:p>The Materials Genome Initiative requires the crossing of material calculations, machine learning, and experiments to accelerate the material development process. In recent years, data-based methods have been applied to the thermoelectric field, mostly on the transport properties. In this work, we combined data-driven machine learning and first-principles automated calculations into an active learning loop, in order to predict the p-type power factors (PFs) of diamond-like pnictides and chalcogenides. Our active learning loop contains two procedures (1) based on a high-throughput theoretical database, machine learning methods are employed to select potential candidates and (2) computational verification is applied to these candidates about their transport properties. The verification data will be added into the database to improve the extrapolation abilities of the machine learning models. Different strategies of selecting candidates have been tested, finally the Gradient Boosting Regression model of Query by Committee strategy has the highest extrapolation accuracy (the Pearson <jats:italic>R</jats:italic> = 0.95 on untrained systems). Based on the prediction from the machine learning models, binary pnictides, vacancy, and small atom-containing chalcogenides are predicted to have large PFs. The bonding analysis reveals that the alterations of anionic bonding networks due to small atoms are beneficial to the PFs in these compounds.</jats:p>"

Post-treatment of the TIM with a silane coupling agent further reduced the TIM thermal contact resistance by 30%. When the TIM was placed between a TEG device and a copper heat reservoir, the TEG output power increased with the temperature difference across the TEG and applied pressure. Moreover, the post-treatment of the TIM enhanced the output power of the TEG device by up to 18.5%. This work provides a simple and effective pathway towards a carbon-based TIM that can be applied to a high temperature TEG.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>This paper describes an experimental study on a combined assembly of a solar pond and two-phase thermosyphon toward thermoelectric power generation under actual weather conditions and proposes its mandatory association with the biomass energy-based system. Experiments under the studied solar radiation intensity ranging between 26 W/m2 and 976 W/m2 reveal that the maximum steady-state temperature potential during the actual operation of a solar pond is not sufficient to generate the minimum threshold thermoelectric voltage for deriving necessary power needed to recharge a 12 V battery. It is also highlighted that solar radiation heats both the upper and the lower layers nearly equally; however, the heat is lost at a faster rate from the upper layer than the lower layer. Consequently, with the passage of time, the temperature of the lower layer rises, and interestingly, the probability of obtaining maximum voltage during a day is maximum during the early morning. Under the present set of conditions, the maximum temperature gain is 26.58 °C, whereas a minimum temperature potential of 45.62 °C is found necessary to produce the required voltage. The economic analysis of the proposed system reveals that the electricity generation obtained from the proposed system is better than diesel power generation. In particular, the system is suitable for locations where access to the conventional grid-based power is difficult. The work opens opportunities and establishes the necessity of developing low-cost thermoelectric materials for further improving the cost of power generation.</jats:p>"

Amongst the possible fabrication techniques, electrodeposition has attracted attention due to its simplicity and low cost. However, the measurement of the thermoelectric properties of electrodeposited films is challenging because of the conducting seed layer underneath the film. Here, we develop a method to directly measure the thermoelectric properties of electrodeposited bismuth telluride thin films, grown on indium tin oxide. Using this technique, the temperature dependent thermoelectric properties (Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity) of electrodeposited thin films have been measured down to 100 K. A parallel resistor model is employed to discern the signal of the film from the signal of the seed layer and the data are carefully analysed and contextualized with literature. Our analysis demonstrates that the thermoelectric properties of electrodeposited films can be accurately evaluated without inflicting any damage to the films.</jats:p>"

              <jats:p>The ‘phonon-glass electron-crystal’ concept has triggered most of the progress that has been achieved in inorganic thermoelectrics in the past two decades. Organic thermoelectric materials, unlike their inorganic counterparts, exhibit molecular diversity, flexible mechanical properties and easy fabrication, and are mostly ‘phonon glasses’. However, the thermoelectric performances of these organic materials are largely limited by low molecular order and they are therefore far from being ‘electron crystals’. Here, we report a molecularly n-doped fullerene derivative with meticulous design of the side chain that approaches an organic ‘PGEC’ thermoelectric material. This thermoelectric material exhibits an excellent electrical conductivity of &gt;10 S cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and an ultralow thermal conductivity of &lt;0.1 Wm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, leading to the best figure of merit <jats:italic>ZT</jats:italic> = 0.34 (at 120 °C) among all reported single-host n-type organic thermoelectric materials. The key factor to achieving the record performance is to use ‘arm-shaped’ double-triethylene-glycol-type side chains, which not only offer excellent doping efficiency (~60%) but also induce a disorder-to-order transition upon thermal annealing. This study illustrates the vast potential of organic semiconductors as thermoelectric materials.</jats:p>"

              <jats:p>It has been demonstrated that many promising thermoelectric materials, such as tetradymite compounds are also three-dimensional topological insulators. In both cases, a fundamental question is the evaluation of carrier relaxation time, which is usually a rough task due to the complicated scattering mechanisms. Previous works using the simple deformation potential theory or considering complete electron-phonon coupling are, however, restricted to small systems. By adopting a data-driven method named SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator) with the training data obtained via deformation potential theory, we propose an efficient and physically interpretable descriptor to evaluate the relaxation time, using tetradymites as prototypical examples. Without any input from first-principles calculations, the descriptor contains only several elemental properties of the constituent atoms, and could be utilized to quickly and reliably predict the carrier relaxation time of a substantial number of tetradymites with arbitrary stoichiometry.</jats:p>"

              <jats:p>Understanding and controlling point defects in semiconductors are essential for developing advanced electronic and optoelectronic devices. Germanium telluride (GeTe), a semiconductor with a rhombohedral-to-cubic structural phase transition and a high concentration of intrinsic vacancies on the Ge sublattice, has recently attracted much interest for thermoelectric applications. However, the role of Ge vacancies in structural change and performance optimization remains obscure. Herein, we first unraveled the importance of Ge vacancies by combining first-principles calculations and Boltzmann transport theory. It is revealed that (1) Ge vacancies are more likely to spontaneously form in cubic GeTe, addressing its defective character; (2) Ge vacancies play a vital role in stabilizing cubic GeTe; and (3) Ge vacancies produce unfavorable band structure modification, leading to a reduced power factor. The following experiment found that AgInTe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> alloying promotes a symmetry change from rhombohedral to cubic and deteriorates the thermoelectric performance, in good agreement with the abovementioned conclusions. More importantly, a single-phase cubic GeTe-based material with stable n-type conduction was first discovered based on the defect chemistry approach. Our findings shed new light on the critical role of Ge vacancies in the structure-property relationship and stimulate the strategy of point defect engineering for future thermoelectric applications.</jats:p>"

Nano-engineering an NW photodetector combining high sensitivity with high speed (sub-ns) in the THz regime at RT is highly desirable for many frontier applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics, but this requires a clear understanding of the origin of the photo-response. Conventional electrical and optical measurements, however, cannot unambiguously determine the dominant detection mechanism due to inherent device asymmetry that allows different processes to be simultaneously activated. Here, we innovatively capture snapshots of the photo-response of individual InAs nanowires via high spatial resolution (35 nm) THz photocurrent nanoscopy. By coupling a THz quantum cascade laser to scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and monitoring both electrical and optical readouts, we simultaneously measure transport and scattering properties. The spatially resolved electric response provides unambiguous signatures of photo-thermoelectric and bolometric currents whose interplay is discussed as a function of photon density and material doping, therefore providing a route to engineer photo-responses by design.</jats:p>"

              <jats:p>2D materials open the possibility to study Dirac electrons in complex self-similar geometries. The two-dimensional nature of materials like graphene, silicene, phosphorene and transition-metal dichalcogenides allow the nanostructuration of complex geometries through metallic electrodes, interacting substrates, strain, etc. So far, the only 2D material that presents physical properties that directly reflect the characteristics of the complex geometries is monolayer graphene. In the present work, we show that silicene nanostructured in complex fashion also displays self-similar characteristics in physical properties. In particular, we find self-similar patterns in the conductance, spin polarization and thermoelectricity of Cantor-like silicene structures. These complex structures are generated by modulating electrostatically the silicene local bandgap in Cantor-like fashion along the structure. The charge carriers are described quantum relativistically by means of a Dirac-like Hamiltonian. The transfer matrix method, the Landauer–Büttiker formalism and the Cutler–Mott formula are used to obtain the transmission, transport and thermoelectric properties. We numerically derive scaling rules that connect appropriately the self-similar conductance, spin polarization and Seebeck coefficient patterns. The scaling rules are related to the structural parameters that define the Cantor-like structure such as the generation and length of the system as well as the height of the potential barriers. As far as we know this is the first time that a 2D material beyond monolayer graphene shows self-similar quantum transport as well as that transport related properties like spin polarization and thermoelectricity manifest self-similarity.</jats:p>"

28152,"<jats:p>In this work we theoretically explore the effect of dimensionality on the thermoelectric power factor of indium arsenide (InA) nanowires by coupling atomistic tight-binding calculations to the Linearized Boltzmann transport formalism. We consider nanowires with diameters from 40 nm (bulk-like) down to 3 nm close to one-dimensional (1D), which allows for the proper exploration of the power factor within a unified large-scale atomistic description across a large diameter range. We find that as the diameter of the nanowires is reduced below d &lt; 10 nm, the Seebeck coefficient increases substantially, as a consequence of strong subband quantization. Under phonon-limited scattering conditions, a considerable improvement of ~6× in the power factor is observed around d = 10 nm. The introduction of surface roughness scattering in the calculation reduces this power factor improvement to ~2×. As the diameter is decreased to d = 3 nm, the power factor is diminished. Our results show that, although low effective mass materials such as InAs can reach low-dimensional behavior at larger diameters and demonstrate significant thermoelectric power factor improvements, surface roughness is also stronger at larger diameters, which takes most of the anticipated power factor advantages away. However, the power factor improvement that can be observed around d = 10 nm could prove to be beneficial as both the Lorenz number and the phonon thermal conductivity are reduced at that diameter. Thus, this work, by using large-scale full-band simulations that span the corresponding length scales, clarifies properly the reasons behind power factor improvements (or degradations) in low-dimensional materials. The elaborate computational method presented can serve as a platform to develop similar schemes for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) material electronic structures.</jats:p>"

The significantly different surface character and transport behavior of sc-SWNT and met-SWNT frequently raise the difficulty of modifying microstructures, and tuning transport properties of SWNTs/organic composites, when using mix-SWNTs as dispersion phase. Herein, we prepared high quality sc-SWNTs/rr-P3DDT composite film by presorting pure sc-SWNT from the raw mix-SWNTs using regioregular poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (rr-P3DDT). Both the smoothness and compactness of sc-SWNTs/rr-P3DDT are great improved, as compared with the mix-SWNTs/rr-P3DDT films, and the sc-SWNTs are well-dispersed and uniformly wrapped by rr-P3DDT with diameter less than 50 nm.

28329,"<jats:p>The increased focus on global climate change has meant that the thermoelectric market has received considerably more attention. There are many processes producing large amounts of waste heat that can be utilised to generate electrical energy. Thermoelectric devices have long suffered with low efficiencies, but this can be addressed in principle by improving the performance of the thermoelectric materials these devices are manufactured with. This paper investigates the thermoelectric performance of market standard thermoelectric materials before analysing how this performance can be improved through the adoption of various nanotechnology techniques. This analysis is carried out through the computational simulation of the materials over low-, mid- and high-temperature ranges. In the low-temperature range, through the use of nanopores and full frequency phonon scattering, Mg0.97Zn0.03Ag0.9Sb0.95 performed best with a ZT value of 1.45 at 433 K. Across the mid-temperature range a potentially industry leading ZT value of 2.08 was reached by AgSbTe1.85Se0.15. This was carried out by simulating the effect of band engineering and the introduction of dense stacking faults due to the addition of Se into AgSbTe2. AgSbTe1.85Se0.15 cannot be implemented in devices operating above 673 K because it degrades too quickly. Therefore, for the top 200 K of the mid-temperature range a PbBi0.002Te–15% Ag2Te nanocomposite performed best with a maximum ZT of 2.04 at 753 K and maximum efficiency of 23.27 at 813 K. In the high-temperature range, through the doping of hafnium (Hf) the nanostructured FeNb0.88Hf0.12Sb recorded the highest ZT value of 1.49 at 1273 K. This was closely followed by Fe1.05Nb0.75Ti0.25Sb, which recorded a ZT value of 1.31 at 1133 K. This makes Fe1.05Nb0.75Ti0.25Sb an attractive substitute for FeNb0.88Hf0.12Sb due to the much lower cost and far greater abundance of titanium (Ti) compared with hafnium.</jats:p>"

28348,"<jats:p>The efficiency of a thermoelectric (TE) generator for the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy can be easily but roughly estimated using a constant properties model (CPM) developed by Ioffe. However, material properties are, in general, temperature (T)-dependent and the CPM yields meaningful estimates only if physically appropriate averages, i.e., spatial averages for thermal and electrical resistivities and the temperature average (TAv) for the Seebeck coefficient (α), are used. Even though the use of αTAv compensates for the absence of Thomson heat in the CPM in the overall heat balance, we find that the CPM still overestimates performance (e.g., by up to 6% for PbTe) for many materials. The deviation originates from an asymmetric distribution of internally released Joule heat to either side of the TE leg and the distribution of internally released Thomson heat between the hot and cold side. The Thomson heat distribution differs from a complete compensation of the corresponding Peltier heat balance in the CPM. Both effects are estimated quantitatively here, showing that both may reach the same order of magnitude, but which one dominates varies from case to case, depending on the specific temperature characteristics of the thermoelectric properties. The role of the Thomson heat distribution is illustrated by a discussion of the transport entropy flow based on the α(T) plot. The changes in the lateral distribution of the internal heat lead to a difference in the heat input, the optimum current and thus of the efficiency of the CPM compared to the real case, while the estimate of generated power at maximum efficiency remains less affected as it is bound to the deviation of the optimum current, which is mostly &lt;1%. This deviation can be corrected to a large extent by estimating the lateral Thomson heat distribution and the asymmetry of the Joule heat distribution. A simple guiding rule for the former is found.</jats:p>"

Our technique makes use of a locally generated thermal gradient converted into a thermoelectric photocurrent that is read out in the underlying device. The thermal gradient is generated by an illuminated atomic force microscope tip that localizes power absorption onto the sample surface. The detection principle is illustrated using a concept device that contains a nanostructured strip of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) defined by electron beam lithography. The platform’s capabilities are demonstrated through a comparison between the spectrum obtained by on-chip thermoelectric nanospectroscopy with a nano-FTIR spectrum recorded by scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy at the same position. The subwavelength spatial resolution is demonstrated by a spectral line scan across the edge of the PMMA layer.</jats:p>
28373,"<jats:p>In this study, we report the influence of Te vacancy formation on the thermoelectric properties of n-type Cu0.008Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 alloys, including their electronic and thermal transport properties. Te-deficient Cu0.008Bi2Te2.7-xSe0.3 (x = 0, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.02) samples were systematically synthesized and characterized. Regarding electronic transport properties, carrier concentration was increased with Te vacancies, while carrier mobility was maintained. As a result, the electrical conductivity significantly increased while the Seebeck coefficient reduced moderately, thus, the power factor was enhanced from 3.04 mW/mK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (pristine) to 3.22 mW/mK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (x = 0.02) at 300 K. Further analysis based on a single parabolic band model revealed that the weighted mobility of the conduction band increased, which is favorable for electron transport, as Te vacancies were generated. Regarding thermal transport properties, lattice thermal conductivity decreased with Te vacancies due to additional point defect phonon scattering, however, total thermal conductivity increased due to larger electronic contribution as Te vacancies increased. Analysis using the Debye-Callaway model suggests that the phonon scattering by the Te vacancies is as efficient as the substitution point defect scattering. Consequently, the thermoelectric figure of merit zT increased at all temperatures for x = 0.005 and 0.01. The maximum zT of 0.95 was achieved for Te-deficient Cu0.008Bi2Te2.69Se0.3 (x = 0.01) at 400 K.</jats:p>"
28374,"<jats:p>In this article, peridynamic (PD) theory is applied to analyze two-dimensional heat conduction of thermoelectric plate with discontinuities. It is a well-known fact that heat flux is undefined at the crack tip and causes the temperature field across the crack surface discontinuous. Hence, numerical procedures like finite element method (FEM) became unsuccessful to capture details of moving discontinuities like growing cracks. Therefore, this article proposes a PD theory that is appropriate in resolving moving discontinuities in thermal and electric fields. The PD equations were constructed by writing the continuum-based electrical potentials and temperature fields in the form of their respective non-local integrals that are remarkably powerful in solving continuum problems whether the authors have moving discontinuities or not. To elucidate the trustworthiness of the PD theory, the results in the case of stationary cracks are compared with the one from FEM and witnessed that they were in good agreement.</jats:p>"

28409,"<jats:p>The spin-Seebeck effect (SSE) is an advective transport process traditionally studied in bilayers composed of a ferromagnet (FM) and a non-magnetic metal (NM) with strong spin-orbit coupling. In a temperature gradient, the flux of magnons in the FM transfers spin-angular momentum to electrons in the NM, which by the inverse spin-Hall effect generates an SSE voltage. In contrast, the Nernst effect is a bulk transport phenomenon in homogeneous NMs or FMs. These effects share the same geometry, and we show here that they can be added to each other in a new combination of FM/NM composites where synthesis via in-field annealing results in the FM material (MnBi) forming aligned needles inside an NM matrix with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) (Bi). Through examination of the materials’ microstructural, magnetic, and transport properties, we searched for signs of enhanced transverse thermopower facilitated by an SSE contribution from MnBi adding to the Nernst effect in Bi. Our results indicate that these two signals are additive in samples with lower MnBi concentrations, suggesting a new way forward in the study of SSE composite materials.</jats:p>"

Previous photothermoelectric (PTE) studies have suggested that the thermoelectric properties of polycrystalline metal nanowires are related to grain structure, although direct evidence linking crystal microstructure to the PTE response is difficult to elucidate. Here, we show that room temperature scanning PTE measurements are sensitive probes that can detect subtle changes in the local Seebeck coefficient of gold tied to the underlying defects and strain that mediate crystal deformation. This connection is revealed through a combination of scanning PTE and electron microscopy measurements of single-crystal and bicrystal gold microscale devices. Unexpectedly, the photovoltage maps strongly correlate with gradually varying crystallographic misorientations detected by electron backscatter diffraction. The effects of individual grain boundaries and differing grain orientations on the PTE signal are minimal.

28508,"<jats:p>Depending on the application of bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials in cooling, waste heat recovery, or wearable electronics, their material properties, and geometrical dimensions should be designed to optimize their performance. Recently, thermoelectric materials have gained a lot of interest in wearable electronic devices for body heat harvesting and cooling purposes. For efficient wearable electronic devices, thermoelectric materials with optimum properties, i.e., low thermal conductivity, high Seebeck coefficient, and high thermoelectric figure-of-merit (zT) at room temperature, are demanded. In this paper, we investigate the effect of glass inclusion, microwave processing, and annealing on the synthesis of high-performance p-type (BixSb1−x)2Te3 nanocomposites, optimized specially for body heat harvesting and body cooling applications. Our results show that glass inclusion could enhance the room temperature Seebeck coefficient by more than 10% while maintaining zT the same. Moreover, the combination of microwave radiation and post-annealing enables a 25% enhancement of zT at room temperature. A thermoelectric generator wristband, made of the developed materials, generates 300 μW power and 323 mV voltage when connected to the human body. Consequently, MW processing provides a new and effective way of synthesizing p-type (BixSb1−x)2Te3 alloys with optimum transport properties.</jats:p>"

The results indicated that the electrical conductivity decreased with a rise in Nb content in the CoCrFeNiNbx alloys, which resulted from the increased eutectic structure and phase interface. Moreover, the thermal conductivity increased with increased Nb content at low temperature (T ≤ 473 K), while thermal conductivity decreased at high temperature (T &gt; 573 K).

The classification of raw materials for the production of GCB has been developed taking into account the genesis, which contributes to the prediction of the properties of composites. The features of the hydration phase formation and hardening of GCB have been studied taking into account the chemical, structural and morphological features of fly ash and slag. In addition, the microstructural, morphological, and thermal properties of the cured binders at a 28 day cure were determined. For the first time, scientific data on the properties of gypsum-cement fiber-reinforced composite using TPPW and microfiber have been obtained. The results show that the synergistic effect of gypsum-cement binder, TPPW, and polyamide or basalt microfiber improves the physicomechanical properties of a 28 day cured binder: compressive strength of 20 MPa, flexural strength of 8.9 MPa, and softening coefficient 0.87.</jats:p>"

However, manufacturing costs of commercial ceramic membranes are still relatively expensive, which promotes the development of new methods for preparing low-cost ceramic membranes. In this study, a method for the preparation of porous ceramic membrane supports is proposed. Low-cost fly ash from power plants is the main material of the membrane supports, and talcum is the additive. The fabrication process of the ceramic membrane supports is described in detail. The properties of the supports were fully characterized, including surface morphology, phase composition, pore diameter distribution, and porosity. The mechanical strength of the supports was measured. The obtained ceramic membrane supports displays a pore size of about 5 μm and porosity of 37.8%. Furthermore, the water recovery performance of the supports under different operating conditions was experimentally studied. The experimental results show that the recovered water flux varies with operating conditions. In the study, the maximum recovered water flux reaches 5.22 kg/(m2·h).

EMI shielding materials block the unwanted electromagnetic waves from reaching the target material. EMI issues can be solved by using a new family of building blocks constituted of polymer and nanofillers. The electromagnetic absorption index of this material is calculated by measuring the “S-parameters”. In this article, we investigated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the EMI shielding field by developing a new system based on a multilayer perceptron neural network designed to predict the electromagnetic absorption of polycarbonate-carbon nanotubes composites films. The proposed system included 15 different multilayer perception (MLP) networks; each network was specialized to predict the absorption value of a specific category sample. The selection of appropriate networks was done automatically, using an independent block. Optimization of the hyper-parameters using hold-out validation was required to ensure the best results. To evaluate the performance of our system, we calculated the similarity error, precision accuracy, and calculation time.

In this study, a 2D mathematical model is formulated to analyze the performance of a two-tank thermochemical heat storage system using metal hydrides pair (Mg2Ni/LaNi5), for high-temperature waste heat recovery. Moreover, the system integrates a phase change material (PCM) to store and restore the heat of reaction of LaNi5. The effects of key properties of the PCM on the dynamics of the heat storage system were analyzed. Then, the TES was optimized using a genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimization tool (NSGA-II), to maximize the power density, the energy density and storage efficiency simultaneously. The results indicate that the melting point Tm and the effective thermal conductivity of the PCM greatly affect the energy storage density and power output. For the range of melting point Tm = 30–50 °C used in this study, it was shown that a PCM with Tm = 47–49 °C leads to a maximum heat storage performance. Indeed, at that melting point narrow range, the thermodynamic driving force of reaction between metal hydrides during the heat charging and discharging processes is almost equal. The increase in the effective thermal conductivity by the addition of graphite brings about a tradeoff between increasing power output and decreasing the energy storage density. Finally, the hysteresis behavior (the difference between the melting and freezing point) only negatively impacts energy storage and power density during the heat discharging process by up to 9%.

Thorough investigations of IR properties including absorption and emission were proceeded with careful calibration and measurement with a CMOS thermoelectric sensor. The thermocouples of the sensor consist of aluminum and n-polysilicon layers which are fabricated with the TSMC 0.35 μm CMOS process and MEMS post-process. In order to improve the adhesion of rGO, a sensing area at the center of the membrane is formed with an array of holes, which is easy for the drop-coating of rGO material upon the sensing region. To evaluate the performance of the IR sensor with rGO, different conditions of the IR thermal radiation experiments were arranged. The results show that the responsivity of our proposed CMOS-MEMS IR sensor with rGO increases by about 77% compared with the sensor without rGO. For different IR absorption incident angles, the measurement of field of view shows that the CMOS-MEMS IR sensor with rGO has a smaller view angle, which can be applied for the application of long-distance measuring. In addition, characteristics of the proposed thermopile are estimated and analyzed with comparisons to the available commercial sensors by the experiments.</jats:p>"

In this work, this technique has been used to produce highly improved thermoelectric (TE) material based on aluminum (Al) doped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures (NSs). The effect of Al dopant at the concentration range 0.5–3 mol % on the structural and TE properties has been investigated in more details. The optimum concentration of Al for better TE performance is found to be 2 mol %, which could significantly increase the electrical conductivity and reduce the thermal conductivity of ZnO NSs and thus enhance the TE performance. This concentration showed almost metallic conductivity behavior for ZnO NSs at low temperatures, e.g., below 500 K. The electrical conductivity reached 400 S/m at room temperature, which is around 200 times greater than the value recorded for the pure ZnO NSs. Remarkably, the measured room temperature thermal conductivity of the microwave synthesized ZnO NSs was very low, which is around 4 W/m·K. This value was further reduced to 0.5 W/m·K by increasing the Al doping to 3 mol %. The figure of merit recorded 0.028 at 675 K, which is 15 times higher than that of the pure ZnO NSs. The output power of a single leg module made of 2 mol % Al doped ZnO NSs was 3.7 µW at 485 K, which is higher by 8 times than that of the pure sample. These results demonstrated the advantage of the microwave irradiation rout as a superior synthetic technique for producing and doping promising TE nanomaterials like ZnO NSs.</jats:p>"

The low efficiency of thermoelectric devices has limited their applications to certain areas, such as refrigeration, heat recovery, power generation and renewable energy. However, for specific applications like space probes, laboratory equipment and medical applications, where cost and efficiency are not as important as availability, reliability and predictability, thermoelectricity offers noteworthy potential. The challenge of making thermoelectricity a future leader in waste heat recovery and renewable energy is intensified by the integration of nanotechnology. In this review, state-of-the-art thermoelectric generators, applications and recent progress are reported. Fundamental knowledge of the thermoelectric effect, basic laws, and parameters affecting the efficiency of conventional and new thermoelectric materials are discussed. The applications of thermoelectricity are grouped into three main domains. The first group deals with the use of heat emitted from a radioisotope to supply electricity to various devices. In this group, space exploration was the only application for which thermoelectricity was successful. In the second group, a natural heat source could prove useful for producing electricity, but as thermoelectricity is still at an initial phase because of low conversion efficiency, applications are still at laboratory level. The third group is progressing at a high speed, mainly because the investigations are funded by governments and/or car manufacturers, with the final aim of reducing vehicle fuel consumption and ultimately mitigating the effect of greenhouse gas emissions.</jats:p>"

Waste heat recovery (WHR) systems offer options to improve the efficiency of an ICE. This is due to the ICE releasing approximately one third of the combustion energy as waste heat into the atmosphere. This paper focuses on one such upcoming system by analysing the efficiency of a thermoelectric generator (TEG) used as a waste heat recovery system in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). It summarises how the efficiency of the TEG can be improved by considering parameters such as the size of module, materials used, and the number of modules needed for the TEG system. The results obtained are then compared with other types of WHR system such as the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and turbocompounding (T/C) implemented on the same type of engine. The research is based on a 1.8 L Toyota Prius-type engine. The TEG model simulated in this research can generate a maximum power of 1015 W at an engine speed of 5200 RPM. The overall system efficiency of TEG implemented on the HEV model is 6% with the average engine speed operating at 2000 RPM.</jats:p>"

A copolymer (P3) with an alternating donor–acceptor (D-A) structure exhibits a narrower band gap and higher carrier mobility, which may be due to the D-A structure that helps reduce the charge carrier transport obstacles. In the end, its power factor reaches 4.91 μW m−1 K−2 at room temperature after doping, which is superior to those of non-D-A IDT-based copolymers (P1 and P2).

Using electron scattering, it was recently observed that, in addition to Bragg diffraction from the average cubic half-Heusler structure, some of these samples show broad diffuse scattering indicating short-range vacancy order, while other samples show sharp additional peaks indicating long-range vacancy ordering. Here it is shown that both the short- and long-range ordering can be explained using the same simple model, which assumes that vacancies in the <jats:italic>X</jats:italic> substructure avoid each other. The samples showing long-range vacancy order are in agreement with the predicted ground state of the model, while short-range order samples are quenched high-temperature states of the system. A previous study showed that changes in sample stoichiometry affect whether the short- or long-range vacancy structure is obtained, but the present model suggests that thermal treatment of samples should allow controlling the degree of vacancy order, and thereby the thermal conductivity, without changes in composition. This is important as the composition also dictates the amount of electrical carriers. Independent control of electrical carrier concentration and degree of vacancy order should allow further improvements in the thermoelectric properties of these systems.</jats:p>"

In this study, we carried out simulation on snowflake shaped phononic crystal and obtained several phononic bandgaps in the THz regime, with the highest being at ≈2 THz. The phononic bandgap position and the width of the bandgap were found to be tunable by varying the neck-length of the snowflake structure. A unique bandgap map computed by varying the neck-length continuously provides enormous amounts of information as to the size and position of the phononic bandgap for various pore dimensions.

28773,"<jats:p>Semiconductor light sources are currently the fastest growing and most energy efficient group of light sources used in lighting technology. Their lighting parameters, such as luminous flux, correlated color temperature and color rendering index depend on the value of the forward current, as well as the temperature of the junction. LED source manufacturers usually specify, in data sheets, the effect of junction temperature and forward current on the luminous flux for individual light sources. The difficulty, however, is the correct determination of temperature and then lighting parameters, by simulation methods for multi-source lighting systems. Determining the junction temperature which affects lighting parameters is particulary important in the case of LED panels and luminaires, where thermally coupled LED sources shaping the output lighting parameters are in close proximity to each other. Additionally, other factors influencing the temperature distribution of sources, such as the design and geometry of the cooling system, the design of the printed circuit and thermal interface material used, should be considered. The article is a continuation of the publication in this journal where the influence of factors influencing the temperature distribution of the LED panel is presented. The purpose of the research in this article was to confirm the possibility of using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software, as well as to determine the accuracy of the results obtained in the temperature analysis of the multi-source LED panel, and in determining the output lighting parameters of the LED panel based on it. In this article, based on previously published research, a LED panel model with a cooling system was made, and then the CFD software determined the junction temperature of all light sources. The determined temperature of the LED sources constituted the basis for determining the output lighting parameters of the panel: luminous flux, color temperature and color rendering index. The simulation results were verified by real measurements on the constructed LED panel prototype. The LED panel temperature difference between the simulation results and the real results on the prototype did not exceed 5%. Moreover, the error of lighting parameters between the simulation results obtained and the results on the LED panel prototype in the worst case was 4.36%, which proves the validity and accuracy of simulation studies.</jats:p>"

28839,"<jats:p>Thermoelectric materials are materials that involve the coexistence of heat flux and electric current in the absence of magnetic field. In such materials, there is a coupling among electric potential and temperature gradients, causing the thermoelectric effects of Seebeck and Peltier. Those coupling effects make the design and analysis of thermoelectric materials complicated and sophisticated. The main aim of this work is dealing with thermoelectric materials with discontinuities. Since heat and electric fluxes are undefined at the crack tip and the temperature and electric fields across the crack surface are discontinuous, it is better to apply peridynamic (PD) theory to capture such details at the crack tips. Hence, we propose in this paper a PD theory which is suitable in tackling such discontinuities in thermal and electric fields. In this study, the continuum-based electrical potentials and temperature fields are written in the form of nonlocal integrals of the electrical potentials and temperature that are effective whether we have discontinuities or not. To illustrate the consistency of the peridynamic technique, a number of examples were presented and witnessed that PD results were in good agreement with those results from the literature, finite element solutions and analytical solutions.</jats:p>"

In this study, we design Ag2Se NPTFs embedded with silicon nanowires (SiNWs) to improve their thermoelectric characteristics. The Seebeck coefficients are −233 and −240 µV/K, respectively, for a Ag2Se NPTF alone and a Ag2Se NPTF embedded with SiNWs. For the Ag2Se NPTF embedded with SiNWs, the electrical conductivity is improved from 0.15 to 18.5 S/m with the embedment of SiNWs. The thermal conductivities are determined by a lateral thermal conductivity measurement for nanomaterials and the thermal conductivities are 0.62 and 0.84 W/(m·K) for a Ag2Se NPTF alone and a Ag2Se NPTF embedded with SiNWs, respectively. Due to the significant increase in the electrical conductivity and the insignificant increase in its thermal conductivity, the output power of the Ag2Se NPTF embedded with SiNWs is 120 times greater than that of the Ag2Se NPTF alone.

A strategy for the application of two types of chalcogenide for improved thermoelectric performance is described herein. Tin selenide (SnSe) is used as a base material, and Te nanoneedles are crystallized in the SnSe, resulting in the generation of a composite structure of SnSe with Te nanoneedles. The thermoelectric properties with various reaction times are investigated to reveal the optimum conditions for enhanced thermoelectric performance. A reaction time of 4 h at 450 K generated a composite Te nanoneedles/SnSe sample with the maximum ZT value, 3.2 times larger than that of the pristine SnSe. This result is attributed to both the reduced thermal conductivity from the effective phonon scattering of heterointerfaces and the improved electrical conductivity value due to the introduction of Te nanoparticles.

SEM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibited an excellent CNT nanodispersion in the TPU matrix. Tensile tests showed no significant deterioration of the moduli and strengths for the 3D printed samples compared to the nanocomposites prepared by compression moulding, indicating an excellent interlayer adhesion and mechanical performance of the 3D printed nanocomposites. Electrical and thermoelectric investigations showed that L-MWCNT exhibits 19.8 ± 0.2 µV/K Seebeck coefficient (S) and 8.4 × 103 S/m electrical conductivity (σ), while TPU/L-MWCNT CPCs at 5.0 wt.% exhibited the highest thermoelectric performance (σ = 133.1 S/m, S = 19.8 ± 0.2 µV/K and PF = 0.04 μW/mK2) among TPU/CNT CPCs in the literature.

It shows that the films prepared under relatively higher power conditions exhibit much higher electrical conductivity to result in a greater power factor accompanied with a minor drop in the Seebeck coefficients. A relationship is established between the improvement in thermoelectric performance and the decrease in crystallinity, which might also reduce the thermal conductivity.

28845,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are usually very expensive, but inexpensive CNTs have been mass-produced by a super-growth (SG) method. The SG-CNTs, however, have many defects resulting in a low conductivity, which is a disadvantage of the SG-CNTs. We discovered that even the defective SG-CNTs can provide a good thermoelectric performance by forming ternary hybrid films made of the SG-CNTs, nanoparticles (NPs) of a conducting polymer complex, poly(nickel 1,1,2,2-ethenetetrathiolate) (PETT) and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC). The good thermoelectric performance of the ternary film (PETT-NP/SG-CNT/PVC) was possibly attributed to the defect repair effect in addition to the bridging effect of the PETT-NPs among the CNTs. In order to confirm this new concept, we attempted the deposition of metal NPs at the defects of the SG-CNTs. We initially made a physical mixture of palladium (Pd) NPs and the SG-CNTs in dispersions to cover the SG-CNT defects with the Pd-NPs. The obtained films showed only a slight improvement in electrical conductivity. Chemical reduction of the Pd ions in the dispersion of the SG-CNTs, on the other hand, provided hybrids with an enhanced electrical conductivity, thus, use as thermoelectric materials. The thermoelectric figure-of-merit was estimated to be ∼0.3, which is a relatively high value for organic hybrid materials.</jats:p>"

For this purpose, material boundaries are utilized and manipulated to affect phonon transmissivity. Specifically, interface intermixing and topography represents a useful but complex parameter for thermal transport modification. This study investigates epitaxial thin film multilayers, so called superlattices (SL), of TiNiSn/HfNiSn, both with pristine and purposefully deteriorated interfaces. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry are used to characterize their structural properties in detail. A differential 3   ω   -method probes their thermal resistivity. The thermal resistivity reaches a maximum for an intermediate interface quality and decreases again for higher boundary layer intermixing. For boundaries with the lowest interface quality, the interface thermal resistance is reduced by 23% compared to a pristine SL. While an uptake of diffuse scattering likely explains the initial deterioration of thermal transport, we propose a phonon bridge interpretation for the lowered thermal resistivity of the interfaces beyond a critical intermixing. In this picture, the locally reduced acoustic contrast of the less defined boundary acts as a mediator that promotes phonon transition.</jats:p>"

Experimental results show that the heat exchanger material, inlet gas temperature, clamping pressure and hot gas backpressure significantly affect the temperature distribution of the hexagonal heat exchanger, the brass hexagonal heat exchanger with lower backpressure and coolant temperature using ice water mixture enhance the temperature difference of TEMs and the overall output performance of TEG.

In this paper, we propose airflow reuse after cooling preceding TEGs to maximize system net power. For the accurate system net power, we model the TEG system, air, and heat source with proper dimension and material characteristics, and simulate with a computational fluid dynamics program. Next, the TEG power generation and the fan power consumption are calculated in consideration of the Seebeck coefficient and internal electrical resistance varying with hot and cold side temperatures. Finally, we find the optimal number of TEGs and fan speed generating the most efficient system net power in various TEG systems. The results show that the system with a side fan with a specific number of TEGs provides a system net power up to 58.6% higher than when with a top fan.

For electronic transport, the power factors of both Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 compositions were increased by Cu doping. The origins of the enhanced power factors were examined using a single parabolic band model, by estimating the changes in deformation potential, effective mass, nondegenerate mobility and weighted mobility in both valence and conduction bands. The weighted mobility of the valence band was increased by Cu doping and increased Sb ratio, while the weighted mobility of the conduction band decreased, suggesting bipolar conduction was greatly reduced. For thermal transport, Cu0.0075Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 and Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 had a lower lattice thermal conductivity than Cu0.0075Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 and Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3, respectively, due to an increase in Umklapp scattering.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO and SnO2 was performed over the Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 powders. After spark plasma sintering at 500 °C for 20 min, the carrier concentration in the ZnO-coated samples decreased, while the carrier concentration in the SnO2-coated samples increased. This trend was more pronounced as the number of ALD cycles increased. This was attributed to the intermixing of the metal ions at the interface. Zn2+ substituted for Bi3+ at the interface acted as an acceptor, while Sn4+ substituted for Bi3+ acted as a donor. This indicates that the carrier concentration can be adjusted depending on the materials deposited with ALD. The use of fine powders changes the carrier concentration more strongly, because the quantity of material deposited increases with the effective surface area. Therefore, the proposed approach would provide opportunities to precisely optimize the carrier concentration for high thermoelectric performance.</jats:p>"

The cooling system, using a 3D-printed plastic material, consists of an S-shaped inlet, four serpentine passages (three U-bends) of variable aspect ratio, and the trailing edge ejection. Angled ribs are implemented inside the passages and the elongated fins and pins are used near the trailing edge. Two dust holes are realized on the blade tip, the injections are individually controlled to reflect the realistic coolant flowrate variation inside the entire internal cooling system. The tests are conducted at two Reynolds number, 45,000 and 60,000 based on the hydraulic diameter of the inlet passage. Transient heat transfer technique using thermochromic liquid crystal is applied to obtain the detailed heat transfer characteristic inside the cooling channel.

In addition, the thermal insulation of the vertical walls and the increased thickness of the radiator fins have a negative effect on the operation of the cooling system.</jats:p>"

Faults on critical components, such as large pumping systems, can lead to material damage and opportunity losses. Pumps plays an essential role in various industries and as such clever maintenance can ensure cost reductions and high availability. Prognostics and Health Management, PHM, is the study utilizing data to estimate the current and future conditions of a system. Within the field of PHM, Predictive Maintenance, PdM, has been gaining increased attention. Data-driven models can be built to estimate the remaining-useful-lifetime of complex systems that would be difficult to identify by man. With the increased attention that the Predictive Maintenance field is receiving, review papers become increasingly important to understand what research has been conducted and what challenges need to be addressed. This paper does so by initially conceptualising the PdM field. A structured overview of literature in regard to application within PdM is presented, before delving into the domain of thermal power plants and pump systems. Finally, related challenges and trends will be outlined. This paper finds that a large number of experimental data-driven models have been successfully deployed, but the PdM field would benefit from more industrial case studies. Furthermore, investigations into the scale-ability of models would benefit industries that are looking into large-scale implementations. Here, examining a method for automatic maintenance of the developed model will be of interest. This paper can be used to understand the PdM field as a broad concept but does also provide a niche understanding of the domain in focus.</jats:p>"

28965,"<jats:p>It is well known that the performance of thermoelectric measured by figure of merit ZT linearly depends on electrical conductivity, while it is quadratic related to the Seebeck coefficient, and the improvement of Seebeck coefficient may reduce electrical conductivity. As a promising thermoelectric material, BiCuOCh (Ch = Se, S) possesses intrinsically low thermal conductivity, and comparing with its p-type counterpart, n-type BiCuOCh has superior electrical conductivity. Thus, a strategy for increasing Seebeck coefficient while almost maintaining electrical conductivity for enhancing thermoelectric properties of n-type BiCuOCh is highly desired. In this work, the effects of uniaxial tensile strain on the electronic structures and thermoelectric properties of n-type BiCuOCh are examined by using first-principles calculations combined with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The results indicate that the Seebeck coefficient can be enhanced under uniaxial tensile strain, and the reduction of electrical conductivity is negligible. The enhancement is attributed to the increase in the slope of total density of states and the effective mass of electron, accompanied with the conduction band near Fermi level flatter along the Γ to Z direction under strain. Comparing with the unstrained counterpart, the power factor can be improved by 54% for n-type BiCuOSe, and 74% for n-type BiCuOS under a strain of 6% at 800 K with electron concentration 3 × 1020 cm−3. Furthermore, the optimal carrier concentrations at different strains are determined. These insights point to an alternative strategy for superior thermoelectric properties.</jats:p>"

SrTiO3, with a high Seebeck coefficient, was used as the N-type inorganic componenet; it was synthesized via a one-pot solvothermal methods and, then, dispersed into the conductive PANI matrix. The SrTiO3 content influenced the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of the resulting composites. The variations in the thermoelectric properties of the SrTiO3/PANI composites consequently changed their power factor; at room temperature, the highest value was ~49.6 μW·m/K2, which is 17 times larger than that of pure PANI.</jats:p>"

This study addresses a major challenge facing the research community today: A great deal of theoretical work predicting exotic states for strongly spin-orbit-coupled, correlated materials has thus far met very limited experimental confirmation. These conspicuous discrepancies are due in part to the extreme sensitivity of these materials to structural distortions. The results presented here demonstrate that the field-altered materials not only are much less distorted but also exhibit phenomena absent in their non-altered counterparts.

29484,"<jats:p>Functional oxides with strongly correlated electron systems, such as vanadium dioxide, manganite, and so on, show a metal-insulator transition and an insulator-metal transition (MIT and IMT) with a change in conductivity of several orders of magnitude. Since the discovery of phase separation during transition processes, many researchers have been trying to capture a nanoscale electronic domain and investigate its exotic properties. To understand the exotic properties of the nanoscale electronic domain, we studied the MIT and IMT properties for the VO2 electronic domains confined into a 20 nm length scale. The confined domains in VO2 exhibited an intrinsic first-order MIT and IMT with an unusually steep single-step change in the temperature dependent resistivity (R-T) curve. The investigation of the temperature-sweep-rate dependent MIT and IMT properties revealed the statistical transition behavior among the domains. These results are the first demonstration approaching the transition dynamics: the competition between the phase-transition kinetics and experimental temperature-sweep-rate in a nano scale. We proposed a statistical transition model to describe the correlation between the domain behavior and the observable R-T curve, which connect the progression of the MIT and IMT from the macroscopic to microscopic viewpoints.</jats:p>"

29555,"<jats:p>We study the synthesis and physical properties of Pb2-xLnxRu2O7- (Ln = Sm, Eu) compounds with pyrochlore structure. The lead-lanthanoid pyrochlores Pb2-xLnxRu2O7- (Ln = Sm, Eu) have been successfully synthesized by the solid-state reaction. All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and electrical resistivity measurements. Magnetic susceptibility measurements showed that the spin-glass transition temperature, TSG, decreases with Ln content x and goes to zero at x = 0.2 and 0.6 for Sm and Eu, respectively. From electric resistivity measurements, a crossover from metallic to semiconducting behavior was observed in the range of 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.4 and 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 0.8 in Pb2-xSmxRu2O7- and Pb2-xEuxRu2O7-, respectively. These boundaries between metallic and insulating phases mostly correspond to values of x with TSG = 0. These metal-insulator transitions can be caused by the strongly correlated couplings between the itinerant 4d electrons which are possibly attributed to the magnetic frustration.</jats:p>"

The title compound exhibited thermally activated-type electrical conductivity along the c-axis. The room temperature (RT) resistivity ρ<jats:sub>RT</jats:sub> along the c-axis and activation energy E<jats:sub>a</jats:sub> rapidly decreased with increasing pressure. The temperature-dependent thermoelectric power S was that of a typical one-dimensional (1D) semiconductor. However the high absolute value of S suggested that this electronic system should be strongly correlated. Although the electrical resistivity exhibited monotonous temperature-dependence, the magnetic susceptibility clearly indicated a Peierls-type transition and marked fluctuation from RT. Both Peierls-type transitions and fluctuations are characteristic phenomena to 1D conductors. Furthermore ESR spectra manifested that the Peierls-type transition occurred at 100 K. The inconsistency between the electrical behavior (without a phase-transition) and magnetic behavior (with a phase-transition) indicates separation of the degrees of freedom in spin and charge (spin-charge separation) of this material. Spin-charge separation is a theoretically predicted phenomenon peculiar to the 1D conductors with strong correlation. The reflectance spectra were quantitatively explained by a 1D Hubbard model, and manifested the existence of a structural fluctuation of this material from RT. Based on these observed physical properties it is concluded that [ Co (2,3- Nc )( CN )<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] CH <jats:sub>3</jats:sub> CN is a strongly correlated 1D semiconductor with a Mott(Hubbard) type energy gap and characterised with a fluctuation and spin-charge separation. </jats:p>"

According to recent studies, the calculated band structure should represent a zero-gap semiconductor at 1 bar that is similar to α-ET2I3 under high pressure (&gt;15 kbar). Such materials have attracted extensive interest because the electrons at the Fermi level can be massless Dirac fermions (MDFs), with relativistic behaviors like those seen in graphene. In fact, α-STF2I3 exhibited nearly temperature-independent resistivity, ρ, (~100–300 K), a phenomenon that is widely observed in zero-gap semiconductors. The non-Arrhenius-type increase in ρ (&lt;~100 K) was consistent with the characteristics of interacting MDFs. The paramagnetic susceptibility, χ, (2–300 K)—as well as the reflectivity, R and optical conductivity, σ, (25–300 K; 400–25,000 cm−1)—were also almost temperature independent. Furthermore, σ was practically independent of wavenumber at ~6000–15,000 cm−1. There was no structural transition based on X-ray studies (90–300 K). Considering all the electrical, magnetic, optical and structural properties of α-STF2I3 at 1 bar, it was concluded that the salt possesses a band structure characterized with Dirac cones, which was consistent with the calculation.</jats:p>"

29627,"<jats:p>Electronic phase separation in complex oxides is the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of electronic phases, involving length scales much larger than those of structural defects or nonuniform distribution of chemical dopants. While experimental efforts focused on phase separation and established its correlation with nonlinear responses under external stimuli, it remains controversial whether phase separation requires quenched disorder for its realization. Early theory predicted that if perfectly “clean” samples could be grown, both phase separation and nonlinearities would be replaced by a bicritical-like phase diagram. Here, using a layer-by-layer superlattice growth technique we fabricate a fully chemically ordered “tricolor” manganite superlattice, and compare its properties with those of isovalent alloyed manganite films. Remarkably, the fully ordered manganite does not exhibit phase separation, while its presence is pronounced in the alloy. This suggests that chemical-doping-induced disorder is crucial to stabilize the potentially useful nonlinear responses of manganites, as theory predicted.</jats:p>"

<jats:p>Complex oxides provide a versatile playground for many phenomena and possible applications, for instance, high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism, ferroelectricity, metal-to-insulator transition, colossal magnetoresistance, and piezoelectricity. The origin of these phenomena is the competition between different degrees of freedom such as charge, orbital, and spin, which are interrelated with the crystal structure, the oxygen stoichiometry, and the doping dependence. Recent developments not only in the epitaxial growth technologies, such as reactive molecular beam epitaxy, but also in the characterization techniques, as aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy with spectroscopic tools, allow synthesizing and identifying epitaxial systems at the atomic scale. Combination of different oxide layers opens access to interface physics and leads to engineering interface properties, where the degrees of freedom can be artificially modified. In this review, we present different homo- and hetero-epitaxial interfaces with extraordinary structural quality and different functionalities, including high-temperature superconductivity, thermoelectricity, and magnetism.</jats:p>"

In Mo<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>23</jats:sub>, an unusual charge density wave transition has been suggested to occur above room temperature, but its low temperature behaviour is particularly enigmatic. We present a comprehensive experimental study of the electronic structure associated with various ordering phenomena in this compound, complemented by theory. Density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a cross-over from a semi-metal with vanishing band overlap to narrow-gap semiconductor behaviour with decreasing temperature. A buried Dirac crossing at the zone boundary is confirmed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) reveals a gradual gap opening corresponding to a metal-to-insulator transition at 343 K in resistivity, consistent with CDW formation and DFT results, but with large non-thermal smearing of the spectra implying strong carrier scattering. At low temperatures, the CDW picture is negated by the observation of a metallic Hall contribution, a non-trivial gap structure in STS below ∼170 K and ARPES spectra, that together represent evidence for the onset of the correlated state at 70 K and the rapid increase of gap size below ∼30 K. The intricate interplay between electronic correlations and the presence of multiple narrow bands near the Fermi level set the stage for metastability and suggest suitability for memristor applications.</jats:p>"

29764,"<jats:p>Abstract. Catalyst materials can be characterized with a thermoelectric gas sensor. Screen-printed thermopiles measure the temperature difference between an inert part of the planar sensor and a part that is coated with the catalyst material to be analyzed. If the overall sensor temperature is modulated, the catalytic activity of the material can be varied. Exothermic reactions that occur at the catalyst layer cause a temperature increase that can then be measured as a sensor voltage due to the Seebeck coefficient of the thermopiles. This mechanism can also be employed at stationary conditions at constant sensor temperature to measure gas concentrations. Then, the sensor signal changes linearly with the analyte concentration. Many variables influence the sensing performance, for example, the offset voltage due to asymmetric inflow and the resulting inhomogeneous temperature distributions are an issue. For even better understanding of the whole sensing principle, it is simulated in this study by a 3-D finite element model. By coupling all influencing physical effects (fluid flow, gas diffusion, heat transfer, chemical reactions, and electrical properties) a model was set up that is able to mirror the sensor behavior precisely, as the comparison with experimental data shows. A challenging task was to mesh the geometry due to scaling problems regarding the resolution of the thin catalyst layer in the much larger gas tube. Therefore, a coupling of a 3-D and a 1-D geometry is shown. This enables to calculate the overall temperature distribution, fluid flow, and gas concentration distribution in the 3-D model, while a very accurate calculation of the chemical reactions is possible in a 1-D dimension. This work does not only give insight into the results at stationary conditions for varying feed gas concentrations and used substrate materials but shows also how various exhaust gas species behave under transient temperature modulation.

29881,"<jats:p>Supercritical water-cooled nuclear reactors (SCWRs) are a Generation IV reactor concept. SCWRs will use a light-water coolant at operating parameters set above the critical point of water (22.1 MPa and 374°C). One reason for moving from current Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) designs to SCW NPP designs is to increase the thermal efficiency. The thermal efficiency of existing NPPs is between 30% and 35% compared with 45% and 50% of supercritical water (SCW) NPPs. Another benefit of SCWRs is the use of a simplified flow circuit, in which steam generators, steam dryers, steam separators, etc. can be eliminated. Canada is in the process of conceptualizing a pressure tube (PT) type SCWR. This concept refers to a 1200-MWel PT-type reactor. Coolant operating parameters are as follows: a pressure of 25 MPa, a channel inlet temperature of 350°C, and an outlet temperature of 625°C. The sheath material and nuclear fuel must be able to withstand these extreme conditions. In general, the primary choice for the sheath is a zirconium alloy and the fuel is an enriched uranium dioxide (UO2). The sheath-temperature design limit is 850°C, and the industry accepted limit for the fuel centerline temperature is 1850°C. Previous studies have shown that the maximum fuel centerline temperature of a UO2 pellet might exceed this industry accepted limit at SCWR conditions. Therefore, alternative fuels with higher thermal conductivities need to be investigated for SCWR use. Uranium carbide (UC), uranium nitride (UN), and uranium dicarbide (UC2) are excellent fuel choices as they all have higher thermal conductivities compared with conventional nuclear fuels such as UO2, mixed oxides (MOX), and thoria (ThO2). Inconel-600 has been selected as the sheath material due its high corrosion resistance and high yield strength in aggressive supercritical water (SCW) at high-temperatures. This paper presents the thermalhydraulics calculations of a generic PT-type SCWR fuel channel with a 43-element Inconel-600 bundle with UC and UC2 fuels. The bulk-fluid, sheath and fuel centerline temperature profiles, together with a heat transfer coefficient profile, were calculated for a generic PT-type SCWR fuel-bundle string. Fuel bundles with UC and UC2 fuels with various axial heat flux profiles (AHFPs) are acceptable since they do not exceed the sheath-temperature design limit of 850°C, and the industry accepted limit for the fuel centerline temperature of 1850°C. The most desirable case in terms of the lowest fuel centerline temperature is the UC fuel with the upstream-skewed cosine AHFP. In this case, the fuel centerline temperature does not exceed even the sheath-temperature design limit of 850°C.</jats:p>"

Strong interfacial interactions existed in both of the composites before and after immersing into the 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) solution as confirmed by UV-Vis-NIR, Raman, XRD and SEM characterizations. After doping the composites by F4TCNQ, the electrical conductivity of the composites increased from 120.32 S cm−1 to 1044.92 S cm−1 in the room temperature. With increasing the temperature, the electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients of the undoped composites both decreased significantly for the composites; the power factor at 475 K was only 6.8 μW m−1 K−2, which was about nine times smaller than the power factor at room temperature (55.9 μW m−1 K−2). In the case of doped composites, although the electrical conductivity was deceased from 1044.9 S cm−1 to 504.17 S cm−1, the Seebeck coefficient increased from 23.76 μV K−1 to 35.69 μW m−1 K−2, therefore, the power factors of the doped composites were almost no change with heating the composite films.</jats:p>"

29929,"<jats:p>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding is a common technology used to protect electronic devices from the interference of environmental noise or to prevent the radiation of electromagnetic waves from electronic devices to the environment. In this research, the EMI shielding principle was utilized to develop a simple and cost-effective wireless corrosion-monitoring sensor. A thin metal sheet (e.g., a steel foil) similar to the material to be monitored was attached onto the surface of a radio frequency identification (RFID) transponder and served as an RF shielding layer to block the communication between the RFID transponder and the transceiver. The shielded transponder (the sensor) was then subjected to corrosion exposure, which caused the corrosion of the shielding metal sheet and led to the degradation of the shielding effectiveness. By chronically recording the change of the RF signal strength and the amount of corrosion that occurred, a correlation could be established between the signal strength and the corrosion rate. In this way, a simple wireless corrosion-monitoring sensor was developed. Steel sheets with various thicknesses (50 μm to 250 μm) were used as shielding layers on ultra-high-frequency RFID transponders, and the sensors covered by these various sheets behaved differently during corrosion exposure. The microstructure change of the shielding material was characterized by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, which revealed the uneven thinning and final damage of the shielding layer, leading to the (partial) restoration of the RF signal.</jats:p>"

Since the sticky TE materials are additionally injected into punched polymer sheets to contact with the upper and bottom electrodes in the fabrication process, the sticky TE modules of ca. 2.4 mm in thickness maintained temperature differences of ca. 10°C and 40°C on a hot plate of 40 °C and 120°C under a natural-air cooling condition with a fin.

29986,"<jats:title>ABSTRACT:</jats:title><jats:p>Thermoelectric (TE) materials, or materials that can generate an electrical energy from temperature gradient, are promising for renewable energy technology. One fundamental aspect in the TE research is the demand to maximize the TE power-factor, PF = S<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> σ, by having as large Seebeck coefficient (S) and electrical conductivity (σ) as possible. In the early 90s, Hicks and Dresselhaus proposed the PF enhancement by using low-dimensional materials, in which electrons are confined in certain directions and they move freely in the other directions. This quantum effect is known as the confinement length (L) effect, in which L is the thickness or diameter of the two-dimensional (2D) or one-dimensional materials, respectively. However, a key challenge is to understand the critical value of L, at which the PF can be significantly enhanced. Recently, we reevaluated the confinement theory of the low-dimensional materials to solve this issue. We showed that electrons are fully confined only when L is smaller than an intrinsic length Λ, the so-called thermal de Broglie wavelength, which depends on the materials and can be experimentally measured. Monolayer 2D materials naturally satisfy the condition of L &lt; Λ since their confinement length is ∼ 1 nm, while their thermal de Broglie wavelength is ∼ 5-10 nm. Therefore, they could be a good candidate for TE materials. In this review article, we first review the TE materials with low dimensions.

Cu2Se is comprised of nontoxic, low-cost and abundant elements, and has been attracting attention because of its very high thermoelectric performance, ZT, at high temperatures. Many studies have reported enhanced ZT in impurity doped Cu2Se, however, little is known about the effect of dopants on the phase transition behavior of Cu2Se. In this study, we prepared (Cu1-xZn)2Se (x = 0 ~ 0.03) compounds by spark plasma sintering, and investigated the phase transition behavior in terms of the temperature-dependent thermoelectric transport properties. Undoped Cu2Se consists of monoclinic α-Cu2Se and berzelianite at room temperature. However, the crystal structure of (Cu1-xZnx)2Se compounds is changed into a single phase of α-Cu2Se with increasing Zn content. As the Zn content increased, electrical conductivity decreased and Seebeck coefficient increased due to the donor role of Zn. The phase transition temperatures of the compounds were characterized as a function of Zn content, based on the temperature-dependent electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients. The phase transition temperature was increased by increasing Zn content, and it was attributed to the disappearance of the berzelianite phase whose phase transition temperature is lower than that of α-Cu2Se. Detailed effects of Zn-doping on both the phase transition behavior and thermoelectric transport properties were discussed.</jats:p>"

Most of these NDE-methods are optimized and applied for the detection of cracks but there is still no reliable NDE method for measuring the embrittlement of RPV steels. However, since the evaluation of RPV embrittlement of so-called Surveillance specimens with the Charpy test is a destructive approach, NDE methods are highly required. Among the investigated technics are acoustic (Ultrasonic scattering), electric (resistivity, thermoelectric) and magnetic (Barkhausen Noise, Non-Linear Harmonics Analysis, Micromagnetic Multiparameter) methods. However, all the methods under investigation suffer from the fact that fracture toughness of steel depends upon several factors, especially on lattice defects such as vacancies, dissolved atoms, dislocation loops, solute clusters, precipitates and dislocations. A major obstacle to the application of NDE methods for the quantification of material embrittlement is that they may be not only sensitive to these defects but also to other factors, such as magnetic, acoustic and electrical properties, as well as to surface quality and ambient temperature, etc.).</jats:p>

               <jats:p>Wet cooling is predominantly used in thermoelectric power plants for condensing steam from the turbine owing to their low system cost and for their ability to render lower turbine back pressure (in comparison to dry cooling). However, the implementation of wet cooling in arid regions is costly while implementation of dry cooling in arid regions can degrade operational reliability (while also increasing both capital costs and operational costs). As a result, alternate technologies are needed to wean power plants from using fresh water resources while also enhancing the operational reliability of dry cooling. Air cooled heat exchangers installed in arid climates are inoperable on certain days during summer as the ambient air temperature can exceed the temperature of the steam at the turbine exhaust and may lead to power plant shutdown, in-turn, causing instability in the electric supply grid infrastructure (thus compromising reliability). In order to combat these shortcomings, supplemental cooling options may be needed. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) platforms can provide an attractive option for supplemental cooling. Phase Change Materials (PCM) are often used as viable options for Latent Heat Thermal Energy Storage Systems (LHTESS) as they have small footprint owing to the high latent heat values of PCM.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The objective of this study is to analyze the performance of various LHTESS platforms by utilizing different configurations of the Heat Exchangers (HX) that are filled with PCM. The scope of this study is limited to using an organic Phase Change Material (PCM) and two different HX configurations are explored in this study: (a) a Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger that was fabricated using Advanced Manufacturing (AM) technique (i.e., “3D Printing”); and (b) a conventional Chevron Plate Heat Exchanger (PHX) that was procured commercially from a vendor. The thermal response and performance characteristics (e.g., power rating and HX effectiveness) of the two HX configurations are measured experimentally in order to ascertain their efficacy for melting and solidification of the PCM for different flow rates and inlet temperature values of the working fluid. The working fluid is called the Heat Transfer Fluid (HTF). The HTF used in this study is tap water. The PCM used in this study is PureTemp 29 (commercially procured from Pure Temp Inc., Minneapolis, MN).</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The propagation of the melt and the freeze fronts were monitored and tracked based on the nature of the transient temperature profiles recorded by an array of thermocouples. The array of thermocouples were strategically mounted at different locations within the HX containing the PCM. For the 3D-Printed HX (Shell and Tube HX), the thermocouples were located at different radial and axial locations within the shell containing the PCM. For the PHX, the thermocouples were located at different heights (for different plates containing the PCM). The transient values of the power and capacity ratings for the HX were estimated based on the time-history of the transient values of the temperature differential for the bulk temperature of the HTF flowing between inlet and outlet ports of the HX (and this was correlated with the transient profile and location as well as the propagation of the solid-liquid interface within the HX).</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The performance characteristics of both HX, analyzed from the experimental data, show that the average power rating for the melting-cycle is consistently higher than that of the solidification-cycle due to the dominance of free convection during melting (resulting in higher values of the effective heat transfer coefficients for the same temperature differential values); while the solidification process is dominated by transient conduction (resulting in lower values of the effective heat transfer coefficients for the same temperature differential values).</jats:p>"

30085,"<jats:p>The results of the studies aimed at increasing the water resistance of the pressed building materials based on gypsum and magnesia binders due to their modification with active dispersed fillers from secondary resources are presented. The gypsum binder modification was carried out by the joint introduction of carbonate-containing sludge from it into the chemical treatment of thermal power plants and monoammonium phosphate, and of magnesia cement - silica fume and finely ground burnt mines.
Physical and mechanical characteristics of the materials’ control samples were determined according to the standards and generally accepted methods. The increase in water resistance of the pressed modified composites was evaluated by changing the softening coefficient. It is shown that when using gypsum binders, an increase in the water resistance of products based on them can be achieved by changing the structure formation of the pressed material and the formation on the elements’ surface of its fine-crystalline structure of the sparingly soluble calcium phosphates’ screening protective films.
The increase in water resistance of pressed products made of modified magnesia binders is explained by the appearance of insoluble hydro silicates, hydro aluminates and hydro aluminosilicates of magnesium, in the structure of the hardened artificial stone as well as the formation of a complex combined structure containing coagulation, condensation and crystallization phases. The technical characteristics of the materials obtained are sufficient for their use, in particular, in the building envelope.

Which found applications to attain the extensive lifetime self-powered operations of various devices such as MEMS wireless sensors, medical implants and wearable electronic devices. Piezoelectric nanogenerators can efficiently convert the vastly available mechanical energy into electrical energy to meet the requirements of low-powered electronic devices. Among the piezoelectric materials, poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers are extensively studied for the development of energy harvesting devices. Due to the outstanding properties such as high flexibility, ease of processing, long-term stability, biocompatibility makes them a promising candidate for piezoelectric generators. Nevertheless, compared to piezoceramic materials, PVDF based generators produce lower piezoresponse. Over the last decades, tremendous research activities have been reported to endorse the performance of PVDF based energy harvesters. This review article mainly focused on the recent progress in the performance improvement with processing methods, piezoelectric materials, different filler loading. The new developments and design structures will lead to an increase in piezoelectricity, alignment of dipoles, dielectric properties and subsequently enhance the output performance of the device.

The main disadvantage of this building material is its high average density, accompanied by high thermal conductivity, which is accompanied by large heat losses through the enclosing walls of buildings and structures. This article discusses the possibility of improving the thermal characteristics of silicate materials through the use of ash microspheres in the production of piece silicate products, which will significantly reduce the thermal conductivity of the manufactured material. Ash microspheres, being a component of ash and slag waste from the thermal power plants, have a number of valuable properties: firstly, very low density, secondly, closed micro porosity, thirdly, chemical and mineralogical composition prone to reactions under conditions of elevated temperatures and pressures. We have studied the chemical and mineralogical composition as well as physical and mechanical properties of ash microspheres, developed the compositions and technological parameters for the silicate materials production. It has been established that the replacement of quartz sand with ash microspheres as part of the molding mass makes it possible to obtain a silicate brick of medium density class 1.0 and strength sufficient to erect load-bearing enclosing products and structures.

The spatial natural vibrations of high-rise ventilation pipes of the Armenian nuclear power plant (NPP) and smokestacks of the Novo-Angren, Syrdarya, Azerbaijan and Ekibastuz thermal power plants (TPP) were studied taking into account the elastic and viscoelastic properties of their material. The reliability of results was verified by comparing the results obtained with the exact solution of a number of test problems, as well as by comparing the results with the results of field experiments. It was found that when the viscoelastic properties of structure material are taken into account, the decrement of their vibrations weakly depends on the values of eigenfrequency.

<jats:title>Background:</jats:title>
<jats:p>Industries such as thermal power plants use coal as a source of energy and
release the combustion products into the environment. The generation of these wastes is inevitable and
thus needed to be reused. In India, coals with high ash content usually between 25 to 45% are used.
The refractory bricks that were used earlier in steel industries were mainly based on silica, magnesia,
chrome, graphite. In modern days, several other materials were introduced for the manufacturing of
refractory bricks such as mullite, chrome-magnesite, zircon, fused cast, and corundum. The materials
selection for refractory brick manufacturing depends on various factors such as the type of furnace and
working conditions.</jats:p>

<jats:p>The current work aims to focus on the fly-ash subjected to spark plasma sintering process
with a maximum temperature of 1500 °C and pressure 60 MPa for 15 minutes and to characterize to
observe the properties with respect to their microstructure.</jats:p>
</jats:sec>
<jats:sec>
<jats:title>Methods:</jats:title>
<jats:p>Fly-ash collected from Rourkela Steel Plant was sintered using spark plasma sintering machine
at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. The powder placed in a die was subjected to a
heating rate of 600-630 K/min, up to a maximum temperature of 1500˚C. The process took 15 minutes
to complete. During the process, the pressure applied was ranging between 50 to 60 Mpa. 5-10 Volts
DC supply was given to the machine with a pulse frequency of 30-40 KHz. The sintered product was
then hammered out of the die and the small pieces of the sintered product were polished for better
characterization. The bricks collected from Hindalco Industries were also hammered into pieces and
polished for characterization and comparison.</jats:p>

<jats:title>Results:</jats:title>
<jats:p>The particles of fly-ash as observed in SEM analysis were spherical in shape with few irregularly
shaped particles. The sintered fly-ash sample revealed grey and white coloured patches distributed
around a black background. These were identified to be the intermetallic compounds that were
formed due to the dissociation of compounds present in fly-ash. High- temperature microscopy analysis
of the sintered sample revealed the initial deformation temperature (IDT) of the fly-ash brick and
the refractory brick which were found to be 1298 °C and 1543 °C, respectively. The maximum hardness
value observed for the sintered fly-ash sample was 450 Hv (4.413 GPa) which is due to the formation
of nano-grains as given in the microstructure. The reason behind such poor hardness value
might be the absence of any binder. For the refractory brick, the maximum hardness observed was
3400 Hv (33.34 GPa). Wear depth for the sintered fly-ash was found to be 451 μm whereas for the refractory
brick sample it was 18 μm.</jats:p>

syn (SiO2), Aluminium Titanium (Al2Ti), Magnesium Silicon (Mg2Si), Maghemite (Fe2O3), Chromium
Titanium (Cr2Ti) and Magnesium Titanium (Mg2Ti), which were responsible for the hardness
achieved in the sample. A large difference in the maximum hardness values of sintered fly-ash and refractory

These accumulative methods have several drawbacks, e.g. that measured loading profiles cannot be used within accumulative lifetime methods without manual corrections, and cannot be combined directly to sophisticated probabilistic methods. Although these methods are widely accepted and used for years, the accumulative lifetime prediction procedures need improvement regarding the lifetime consumption of thermal power plants during flexible operation modes. Furthermore, previous investigations show that the main influencing factor from the materials perspective, the critical damage threshold, cannot be statistically estimated from typical creep-fatigue experiments due to massive experimental effort and a low amount of available data.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>This paper seeks to investigate simple damage mechanics concepts applied to high-temperature components under creep-fatigue loading to demonstrate that these methods can overcome some drawbacks and use improvement potentials of traditional accumulative lifetime methods. Furthermore, damage mechanics models do not provide any reliability information, and the assessment of the resultant lifetime prediction is nearly impossible. At this point, probabilistic methods are used to quantify the missing information concerning failure probabilities and sensitivities and thus, the combination of both provides rigorous information for engineering judgment.</jats:p>

The determination of the specimen stiffness allows a quantification of the damage evolution during the experiment. The model parameters are determined by Nelder-Mead optimization procedure, and the dependencies of the model parameters concerning to different temperatures and strain ranges are investigated. In this paper, polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for uncertainty propagation of the model uncertainties while using non-intrusive methods (regression techniques). In a further post-processing step, the computed PCE coefficients of the damage variable are used to determine the probability of failure as a function of cycles and evolution of the probability density function (pdf).</jats:p>

The parameters computed are energy and exergy efficiencies of the solar collector plate, coefficient of performance, cooling efficiency, exergy destruction rates, thermal exergy loss rates, irreversibility, and exergetic efficiency of the absorption refrigeration cycle. The simulation results indicate that there exists an optimum inlet temperature of collector fluid for the maximum system coefficient of performance and exergetic efficiency. When the cooling system runs at this temperature, the absorber plate volume attains a minimum value. Furthermore, the performance results are significantly better when a higher absorber plate thickness parameter is for the recto-trapezoidal profile. Finally, a comparative study analyzes the collector performance parameters of an absorber plate having rectangular, triangular, or trapezoidal profile by selecting their respective parameters of geometries. When an additional constraint imposes on the plate volume, it found that using a recto-trapezoidal profile instead of a rectangular profile saves at least 30% or more collector material, and also it may have better performance than a triangular or trapezoidal profile. </jats:p>"

To address this problem, herein, we report thermoelectric materials, such as Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, Sb<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, and PbTe, as thermocatalysts which can produce hydrogen peroxide (H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>) under a small surrounding temperature difference. Being the most prevalent environmental factors in daily life, temperature and related thermal effects have tremendous potential for practical applications. To increase the practicality in everyday life, bismuth telluride nanoplates (Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> NPs), serving as an efficient thermocatalyst, are coated on a carbon fiber fabric (Bi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Te<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>@CFF) to develop a thermocatalytic filter with antibacterial function. Temperature difference induced H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> generation by thermocatalysts results in the oxidative damage of bacteria, which makes thermocatalysts highly promising for disinfection applications. Antibacterial activity as high as 95% is achieved only by the treatment of low-temperature difference cycles. The current work highlights the horizon-shifting impacts of thermoelectric materials for real-time purification and antibacterial applications.</jats:p>"

A prerequisite for market competitiveness, however, is the cost-effective and scalable manufacturing of these TEGs. Our approach is to print the devices using printable thermoelectric polymers and composite materials. We present a mass-producible potentially low-cost fully screen printed flexible origami TEG. Through a unique two-step folding technique, we produce a mechanically stable 3D cuboidal device from a 2D layout printed on a thin flexible substrate using thermoelectric inks based on PEDOT nanowires and a TiS<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>:Hexylamine-complex material. We realize a device architecture with a high thermocouple density of 190 per cm² by using the thin substrate as electrical insulation between the thermoelectric elements resulting in a high-power output of 47.8 µWcm<jats:sup>−</jats:sup>² from a 30 K temperature difference. The device properties are adjustable via the print layout, specifically, the thermal impedance of the TEGs can be tuned over several orders of magnitudes allowing thermal impedance matching to any given heat source.

SnSe single crystals have attracted attention as a next generation thermoelectric material due to outstanding thermoelectric properties arising from ultralow thermal conductivity. For practical applications, on the other hand, polycrystalline SnSe should be also focused because the production cost and the flexibility for applications are important factors, which requires the systematic investigation of the stability of thermoelectric performance under a pseudo operating environment. Here, we report that the physical properties of SnSe crystals with nano to submicron scale are drastically modified by atmospheric annealing. We measured the Seebeck effect while changing the annealing time and found that the large positive thermopower, + 757 μV K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>, was completely suppressed by annealing for only a few minutes and was eventually inverted to be the large negative value, − 427 μV K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>.

30292,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The spin-dependent Seebeck effect (SDSE) and thermal spin-filtering effect (SFE) are now considered as the essential aspects of the spin caloritronics, which can efficiently explore the relationships between the spin and heat transport in the materials. However, there is still a challenge to get a thermally-induced spin current with no thermal electron current. This paper aims to numerically investigate the spin-dependent transport properties in hybrid graphene/silicene nanoribbons (GSNRs), using the nonequilibrium Green’s function method. The effects of temperature gradient between the left and right leads, the ferromagnetic exchange field, and the local external electric fields are also included. The results showed that the spin-up and spin-down currents are produced and flow in opposite directions with almost equal magnitudes. This evidently shows that the carrier transport is dominated by the thermal spin current, whereas the thermal electron current is almost disappeared. A pure thermal spin current with the finite threshold temperatures can be obtained by modulating the temperature, and a negative differential thermoelectric resistance is obtained for the thermal electron current. A nearly zero charge thermopower is also obtained, which further demonstrates the emergence of the SDSE. The response of the hybrid system is then varied by changing the magnitudes of the ferromagnetic exchange field and local external electric fields. Thus, a nearly perfect SFE can be observed at room temperature, whereas the spin polarization efficiency is reached up to 99%. It is believed that the results obtained from this study can be useful to well understand the inspiring thermospin phenomena, and to enhance the spin caloritronics material with lower energy consumption.</jats:p>"

From universal conductance fluctuations measured on GeTe nanowires with Au contacts, a phase-coherence length of about 280 nm at 0.5 K is determined. The distinct phase-coherence is confirmed by the observation of Aharonov–Bohm type oscillations for parallel magnetic fields.

For Nb/GeTe-nanowire/Nb Josephson junctions we obtained a critical current of 0.2 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>A at 0.4 K.

30478,"<jats:p>There is a worldwide race to convert waste heat to useful energy using thermoelectric materials. Molecules are attractive candidates for thermoelectricity because they can be synthesised with the atomic precision, and intriguing properties due to quantum effects such as quantum interference can be induced at room temperature. Molecules are also expected to show a low thermal conductance that is needed to enhance the performance of thermoelectric materials. Recently, the technological challenge of measuring the thermal conductance of single molecules was overcome. Therefore, it is timely to develop strategies to reduce their thermal conductance for high performance thermoelectricity. In this paper and for the first time, we exploit systematically the effect of anchor groups on the phonon thermal conductance of oligo (phenylene ethynylene) (OPE3) molecules connected to gold electrodes via pyridyl, thiol, methyl sulphide and carbodithioate anchor groups. We show that thermal conductance is affected significantly by the choice of anchor group. The lowest and highest thermal conductances were obtained in the OPE3 with methyl sulphide and carbodithioate anchor groups, respectively. The thermal conductance of OPE3 with thiol anchor was higher than that with methyl sulphide but lower than the OPE3 with pyridyl anchor group.</jats:p>"

Two kinds of cell designs (a conventional electrochemical cell with a salt bridge and a coin cell-type body) were investigated. It was found that the nature of the surface modification of electrodes can change the internal resistance of the cell by three orders of magnitude. The dependence of the equivalent scheme parameters and output power density of the thermoelectric cell on the type of electrode materials was presented.

30557,"<jats:p>Conducting polymers have attracted significant attention due to their easy fabrication, morphology modification, and their electrical properties. Amongst them, polypyrrole (PPy) has attractive thermoelectric (TE) properties. Engineering of this polymer in one-dimensional (1D) nanostructured form is found to enhance its TE performance. This was achieved in the present work by using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) as a core template to direct the self-assembly of PPy and also to further enhance its TE performance. The growth of PPy on the sidewalls of MWCNTs was performed in an acidic medium based oxidative in situ polymerization. Various concentrations of MWCNTs within the range 1.1–14.6 wt.% were used to form the MWCNTs/PPy nanocomposites in 1D core-shell structures. The morphology and microstructure results of the produced nanocomposite samples showed that this MWCNTs were successfully coated by thick and thin layers of PPy. At low concentrations of MWCNTs, thick layers of PPy are formed. While at high concentrations thin layers are coated. The formed 1D nanocomposites have enhanced TE performance, particularly those containing higher contents of MWCNTs. The power factor and figure of merit values for the formed 1D nanocomposites recorded around 0.77 µV/mK2 and 1 × 10−3 at room temperature (RT), respectively. This enhancement was attributed to the perfect coating and good interaction between PPy and MWCNT through π–π stacking between the polymer chains and these nanotubes. These results might be useful for developing future TE materials and devices. </jats:p>"

MOFs display high porosity, a large specific surface area, and high thermal stability due to the presence of coordination bonds. The pores can incorporate neutral molecules, such as solvent molecules, anions, and cations, depending on the overall charge of the MOF, gas molecules, and biomolecules.

Their extended two-dimensional nano-layer arrangements form directly in situ through electron-beam treatment in the transmission electron microscope. The experiments show the atomistic depletion mechanism of the initial crystal and the recrystallization of PbTe nanoparticles out of the microparticles due to the local atomic-scale transport via the gas phase beyond a threshold current density of the beam.</jats:p>

30603,"<jats:p>Using thermoelectric refrigerators can address climate change because they do not utilize harmful greenhouse gases as refrigerants. To compete with current vapor compression cycle refrigerators, the thermoelectric performance of materials needs to be improved. However, improving thermoelectric performance is challenging because of the trade-off relationship between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Here, we demonstrate that decreasing conductivity effective mass by engineering the shape of the Fermi surface pocket (non-parabolicity factor) can decouple electrical conductivity from the Seebeck coefficient. The effect of engineering the non-parabolicity factor was shown by calculating the electronic transport properties of a state-of-the-art Bi-Sb-Te ingot via two-band model with varying non-parabolicity. The power factor (the product of the Seebeck coefficient squared and electrical conductivity) was calculated to be improved because of enhanced electrical conductivity, with an approximately constant Seebeck coefficient, using a non-parabolicity factor other than unity. Engineering the non-parabolicity factor to achieve lighter conductivity effective mass can improve the electronic transport properties of thermoelectric materials because it only improves electrical conductivity without decreasing the Seebeck coefficient (which is directly proportional to the band mass of a single Fermi surface pocket and not to the conductivity effective mass). Theoretically, it is demonstrated that a thermoelectric figure-of-merit &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; higher than 1.3 can be achieved with a Bi-Sb-Te ingot if the non-parabolicity factor is engineered to be 0.2. Engineering the non-parabolicity factor is another effective band engineering approach, similar to band convergence, to achieve an effective improvement in power factor.</jats:p>"
30604,"<jats:p>Extensive use of fossil fuels can lead to energy depletion and serious environmental pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to solve these problems by developing clean energy. Graphene materials own the advantages of high electrocatalytic activity, high conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, strong flexibility, large specific surface area and light weight, thus giving the potential to store electric charge, ions or hydrogen. Graphene-based nanocomposites have become new research hotspots in the field of energy storage and conversion, such as in fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, solar cells and thermoelectric conversion. Graphene as a catalyst carrier of hydrogen fuel cells has been further modified to obtain higher and more uniform metal dispersion, hence improving the electrocatalyst activity. Moreover, it can complement the network of electroactive materials to buffer the change of electrode volume and prevent the breakage and aggregation of electrode materials, and graphene oxide is also used as a cheap and sustainable proton exchange membrane. In lithium-ion batteries, substituting heteroatoms for carbon atoms in graphene composite electrodes can produce defects on the graphitized surface which have a good reversible specific capacity and increased energy and power densities. In solar cells, the performance of the interface and junction is enhanced by using a few layers of graphene-based composites and more electron-hole pairs are collected; therefore, the conversion efficiency is increased. Graphene has a high Seebeck coefficient, and therefore, it is a potential thermoelectric material. In this paper, we review the latest progress in the synthesis, characterization, evaluation and properties of graphene-based composites and their practical applications in fuel cells, lithium-ion batteries, solar cells and thermoelectric conversion.</jats:p>"

Based on the observation of lubrication in the industrial process, it was found that a significant part of the lubricant fails to reach the die cavity, reaching the outside of it, which causes die wear due to seizure resulting from adhesion of the forging material to the tool surface as well as high lubricant consumption and dirt in the press chamber. The authors proposed their own mobile lubricating and cooling system, which allows for a wide range of adjustments and provided with automatic cleaning procedures of the entire system, unlike the fixed lubrication system used so far in the industrial process. First, tests were carried out in laboratory conditions to determine the highest wettability and the lubricant remaining inside the tool cavity. These tests determined the lubrication system parameter settings that ensured that the greatest amount of lubricant remains in the cold die cavity without the forging process. Then, to verify the obtained results, tests were carried out in the industrial process of hot die forging of valve forgings for short production runs of up to 500 forgings. The results were compared with the measurement of changes in the geometry of tools and forgings based on 3D scanning and surface topography analysis with the use of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope).

The chemical properties of the resulting biochars were investigated, including proximate analysis, concentrations of inorganic species in biochar and ash, and the crystalline structure. All demineralization treatments produced food waste biochar with sufficient calorific value (&gt;4000 kcal/kg) and a chlorine concentration &lt;0.5%. Among the inorganic species in biochar, Na and K exhibited a significantly higher removal rate through demineralization, which ranged from 54.1%–85.6% and 53.6%–89.9%, respectively; the removal rates of Ca and Mg were lower than 50.0%. The demineralization method was more critical than the pyrolysis temperature in the removal of alkali and alkaline earth metals.

The sodium chloride was leached out from the samples in hot water, resulting in porous samples with varying levels of porosity. The electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity were measured at room temperature using a testing apparatus designed and built by the researcher, both before and after the leaching of sodium chloride. From this data, the figure of merit was calculated. Samples of pure bismuth telluride (0% NaCl) served as the baseline samples for comparison. Both the presence of NaCl and pores were efficient at increasing the dimensionless figure of merit. Porous samples initially containing 20% NaCl had a 37.55% higher figure of merit compared to baseline samples, and an 89.07% increase in the figure of merit was seen from the solid samples with NaCl inclusions at a concentration of 30% by volume. The electrical conductivity was negatively affected by both inclusions and porosity, but significant increases in Seebeck coefficient, and reduced thermal conductivity were significantly enough for an overall increase in dimensionless figure of merit. The figure of merit for the baseline sample was approximately 0.18, and the highest values observed for the NaCl inclusion and porous samples were 0.34 and 0.25 respectively. These values are far less than that of what is considered a state of the art thermoelectric material, but the materials and methods used were simple, inexpensive, and scalable, showing great potential for applicability for use with optimized thermoelectric materials in hopes of further increasing their figure of merit.</jats:p>"

          <jats:p>Nanocrystalline thermoelectric materials based on Si have long been of interest because Si is earth-abundant, inexpensive, and non-toxic. However, a poor understanding of phonon grain boundary scattering and its effect on thermal conductivity has impeded efforts to improve the thermoelectric figure of merit. Here, we report an ab-initio based computational study of thermal transport in nanocrystalline Si-based materials using a variance-reduced Monte Carlo method with the full phonon dispersion and intrinsic lifetimes from first-principles as input. By fitting the transmission profile of grain boundaries, we obtain excellent agreement with experimental thermal conductivity of nanocrystalline Si [Wang <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>. Nano Letters 11, 2206 (2011)]. Based on these calculations, we examine phonon transport in nanocrystalline SiGe alloys with ab-initio electron-phonon scattering rates. Our calculations show that low energy phonons still transport substantial amounts of heat in these materials, despite scattering by electron-phonon interactions, due to the high transmission of phonons at grain boundaries, and thus improvements in <jats:italic>ZT</jats:italic> are still possible by disrupting these modes. This work demonstrates the important insights into phonon transport that can be obtained using ab-initio based Monte Carlo simulations in complex nanostructured materials.</jats:p>"

In order to evaluate the suitability of Al as dopant in thermoelectric GeTe, a systematic study of thermoelectric properties of Ge1−xAlxTe (x = 0–0.08) alloys processed by Spark Plasma Sintering are presented here. Being isoelectronic to Ge1−xInxTe and Ge1−xGaxTe, which were reported with improved thermoelectric performances in the past, the Ge1−xAlxTe system is particularly focused (studied both experimentally and theoretically). Our results indicate that doping of Al to GeTe causes multiple effects: (i) increase in p-type charge carrier concentration; (ii) decrease in carrier mobility; (iii) reduction in thermopower and power factor; and (iv) suppression of thermal conductivity only at room temperature and not much significant change at higher temperature. First principles calculations reveal that Al-doping increases the energy separation between the two valence bands (loss of band convergence) in GeTe. These factors contribute for Ge1−xAlxTe to exhibit a reduced thermoelectric figure of merit, unlike its In and Ga congeners.

The results indicated that Ag doping significantly affected the microstructure and thermoelectric properties. With the increase in Ag content and gradual increase in electrical conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient first increased and then decreased, whereas the thermal conductivity exhibited the opposite case. The figure of merit, ZT, was 0.17 at 673 K for the Ca2.8Ag0.2Co4O9 sample.

31199,"<jats:p> Fusion materials research is a worldwide endeavor as old as the parallel one working toward the long term stable confinement of ignited plasma. In a fusion reactor, the preservation of the required minimum thermomechanical properties of the in-vessel components exposed to the severe irradiation and heat flux conditions is an indispensable factor for safe operation; it is also an essential goal for the economic viability of fusion. Energy from fusion power will be extracted from the 14 MeV neutron freed as a product of the deuterium–tritium fusion reactions; thus, this kinetic energy must be absorbed and efficiently evacuated and electricity eventually generated by the conventional methods of a thermal power plant. Worldwide technological efforts to understand the degradation of materials exposed to 14 MeV neutron fluxes [Formula: see text] m[Formula: see text]s[Formula: see text], as expected in future fusion power plants, have been intense over the last four decades. Existing neutron sources can reach suitable dpa (“displacement-per-atom”, the figure of merit to assess materials degradation from being exposed to neutron irradiation), but the differences in the neutron spectrum of fission reactors and spallation sources do not allow one to unravel the physics and to anticipate the degradation of materials exposed to fusion neutrons. Fusion irradiation conditions can be achieved through Li (d, xn) nuclear reactions with suitable deuteron beam current and energy, and an adequate flowing lithium screen. This idea triggered in the late 1970s at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) a campaign working toward the feasibility of continuous wave (CW) high current linacs framed by the Fusion Materials Irradiation Test (FMIT) project. These efforts continued with the Low Energy Demonstrating Accelerator (LEDA) (a validating prototype of the canceled Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) project), which was proposed in 2002 to the fusion community as a 6.7[Formula: see text]MeV, 100[Formula: see text]mA CW beam injector for a Li (d, xn) source to bridge with the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF) under discussion at the time. Worldwide technological efforts are maturing soundly and the time for a fusion-relevant neutron source has arrived according to world fusion roadmaps; if decisions are taken we could count the next decade with a powerful source of 14 MeV neutrons thanks to the expected significant results of the Engineering Validation and Engineering Design Activity (EVEDA) phase of the IFMIF project. The accelerator know-how has matured in all possible aspects since the times of FMIT conception in the 1970s; today, operating 125 mA deuteron beam at 40 MeV in CW with high availabilities seems feasible thanks to the understanding of the beam halo physics and the three main technological breakthroughs in accelerator technology: (1) the ECR ion source for light ions developed at Chalk River Laboratories in the early 1990s, (2) the RFQ operation of H[Formula: see text] in CW with 100 mA demonstrated by LEDA in LANL in the late 1990s, and (3) the growing maturity of superconducting resonators for light hadrons and low [Formula: see text] beams achieved in recent years. </jats:p>"

Here, we address this challenge by providing artificial neural network (ANN) models that can predict TEG performance on demand. Out of the several ANN models considered for TEGs, the most efficient one consists of two hidden layers with six neurons in each layer. The model predicted TEG power with an accuracy of ±0.1 W, and TEG efficiency with an accuracy of ±0.2%.

These compounds have shown a high-power factor and high-power density, as well as good material stability and scalability. Due to their high thermal conductivity, however, the dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of these materials has stagnated near 1 for a long time. Since 2013, the verifiable zT of half-Heusler compounds has risen from 1 to near 1.5 for both n- and p-type compounds in the temperature range of 500–900 °C.

31669,"<jats:p>The application of energy storage filled with phase-change material (PCM) is recently increasingly considered in active cooling systems. Such a design offers a higher density of thermal energy accumulation when compared with water storage. However, the optimum use of PCM storage is possible when its dynamic characteristics during the loading and unloading process are well recognized. Due to the complexity of the interaction between all elements of the heating/cooling system, a theoretical estimation of the profits is hard to perform in a reliable way. This is a significant problem at the design stage of the installation. In order to solve this problem, a laboratory experiment supported by a simulation was performed. The main aim of the experiment was to understand how the storage filled with the PCM in real-like conditions works. A test stand was made to investigate the effect of this solution on a reduced scale of 1:10. The PCM tested was RT15, a commercially available material that melts in the temperature range of 10–17 °C. The main parts of the stand are a chiller, an electric heater and thermal energy storage. The first two elements allowed a simulation of the thermal properties of the heat receiver, and their operation depended on the results from the numerical calculations. A lumped parameter model was used in mathematical description of the office building and its cooling system. The heat capacity of the system components as well as heat losses to the ambient environment were taken into account. The obtained results allowed the optimization of the control procedure and proved the validity of the applied investigation methods.

Different concentrations of NaOH, LiCl, Al2O3, and aqueous glass; different temperature effects (90–120 °C); and different process lengths (6–48 h) were studied. Furthermore, most of the experiments were supplemented with a crystallization phase that was run for 16 h at 50 °C.

The whole test-rig is virtually scaled up, through a cyber-physical system, to emulate a real 400MW combined cycle, with the heat pump governing the inlet conditions at the compressor. The microturbine is therefore used as the physical feedback for the system, whilst the steam bottoming cycle is simulated in real-time according to microturbine operation. The scope is to present the test rig and the procedure adopted to virtually scaleup a microturbine to a heavy-duty GT. the advantage of using microturbine for testing combined cycle flexibility options lays also on the possibility to make accelerated tests and to simulate multiple situations in compressed time windows.</jats:p>"

Iron and nickel were chosen because of their similarities with cobalt. The maximum power factor value of around 200 μWm−1K−2 at 925 K was achieved for the composite with the nominal nickel content of 3% vol., processed via the two-step sintering cycle, which provides the highest densification from this work. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was shown to be strongly dependent on the processing conditions and added amounts of metallic particles. Although the conventional one-step approach results in Fe- and Ni-containing composites with the major content of the thermoelectric Ca3Co4O9 phase, their electrical performance was found to be significantly lower than for the Co-containing analogue, due to the presence of less-conducting phases and excessive porosity. In contrast, the relatively high performance of the composite with a nominal nickel content of 3% vol. processed via a two-step approach is related to the specific microstructural features from this sample, including minimal porosity and the presence of the Ca2Co2O5 phase, which partially compensate the complete decomposition of the Ca3Co4O9 matrix.

Despite SiGe nanowires devices show a lower Seebeck coefficient and a higher electrical resistance, they exhibit a much better performance leading to larger open circuit voltages and a larger overall power supply. This is possible due to the lower thermal conductance of the nanostructured SiGe ensemble that enables a much larger internal temperature difference for the same external thermal gradient.

The unconventional heat dissipation behavior at the side surfaces of the thin-film coil, which serves as a “heat pump,” is strongly dependent on the geometry and the material of the encapsulating dissipation layer (e.g., polyimide). The low heat transfer coefficient of the encapsulation layer, which may damp the heat transfer for a conventional thermoelectric device, usually limits the heat transfer efficiency. However, the unconventional geometry of the coil can take advantage of the low heat transfer coefficient to increase its hot-to-cold temperature difference, and this requires further thermal analysis of the coil in order to improve its power conversion efficiency. Another challenge for the coil is that the active thin-film thermoelectric materials employed (e.g., heavily doped Silicon) are usually very brittle, with the fracture strain less than 0.1% in general while the overall device may undergo large deformation (e.g., stretched 100%). Mechanical analysis is therefore necessary to avoid failure/fracture of the thermoelectric material. In this work, we study the effect of coil geometry on both thermal and mechanical behaviors by using numerical and analytical approaches, and optimize the coil geometry to improve the device performance, and to guide its design for future applications.</jats:p>"

The methodological approach involved the development of the geometrical design of the Ge/SiGe – based Thermoelectric generator (TEG), defining the thermoelectric material properties and boundary conditions and then implementation of the governing equations to obtain an approximate solution via meshing of the TEG module. The developed FEM was then used to optimize the geometry of the TEG with the aim of reducing the contact resistance for improved performances. One way to achieve this is to reduce the thickness of the silicon substrate. Thus by reducing the thickness of the substrate, the thermal losses in the system will be minimized. Secondly, by increasing the superlattice heights, the output voltage also increased and given the anisotropic nature of the superlattice, it was inferred that the optimal voltage measurements can be obtained at the surface of the superlattice which yields the maximum leg height. The relevance of this study is that the FEM allows the simulation of the TEG module for different real-world conditions that would otherwise be expensive and time-consuming to investigate experimentally. It also gives insight to the temperature and voltage distribution of the TEG module under varying operating conditions.</jats:p>"

The thermoelectric generator (TEG) provides a way to reutilize this portion of energy by converting temperature differences into electricity using Seebeck phenomenon. Because the figures of merit zT of the thermoelectric materials are temperature-dependent, it is not feasible to achieve high efficiency of the thermoelectric conversion using only one single thermoelectric material in a wide temperature range. To address this challenge, the authors propose a method based on topology optimization to optimize the layouts of functional graded TEGs consisting of multiple materials. The multimaterial TEG is optimized using the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method. Instead of dummy materials, both the P-type and N-type electric conductors are optimally distributed with two different practical thermoelectric materials. Specifically, Bi2Te3 and Zn4Sb3 are selected for the P-type element while Bi2Te3 and CoSb3 are employed for the N-type element. Two optimization scenarios with relatively regular domains are first considered with one optimizing on both the P-type and N-type elements simultaneously, and the other one only on single P-type element. The maximum conversion efficiency could reach 9.61% and 12.34% respectively in the temperature range from 25 °C to 400 °C. CAD models are reconstructed based on the optimization results for numerical verification. A good agreement between the performance of the CAD model and optimization result is achieved, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>"

The approximately three times enhancement in the power factor of Te, transition metal co-doped samples reported in the literature have all been attributed to a change in the scattering mechanism. However, here it is demonstrated that Te, transition metal co-doping also increased the density-of-states effective mass. Here, the impact of the scattering mechanism change on the electric transport properties of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type Mg2Sb3 without an effective mass increase was studied. Even without the effective mass increase, carrier scattering mechanism engineering improved the power factor, and its effect was maximized by appropriate carrier concentration tuning.</jats:p>"

The genome consists of 3,607,821 bp distributed in 18 contigs with 3337 protein coding genes and 53% of the annotated CDS are having putative functions. Gene annotation disclosed the presence of genes involved in ABC transporter-dependent pathway of EPS biosynthesis. As the ABC transporter-dependent pathway is also implicated in the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) biosynthesis, we employed extraction protocols for both EPS (from the culture supernatants) and CPS (from the cells) and found that the secreted polysaccharide i.e., EPS was predominant. The EPS showed good emulsifying activities against the petroleum hydrocarbons and its production was dependent on the carbon source supplied.

The elemental analysis was done by EDAX. The dielectric response of the crystals was analyzed in the frequency range of 50 Hz to 5 MHz at various temperatures and the outcomes were discussed. The SHG efficiency was estimated in correlation with KDP by employing powder Kurtz method.</jats:p>"

32178,"<jats:p>The present study reported a facile method for the determination of melamine in milk powder products based on the aggregation of reactant-free 5 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). The strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged exocyclic amine groups present in the melamine molecule and the negatively charged ions bound to the AuNPs induced aggregation of the AuNPs, resulting in visible color changes that could be seen with the naked eye and monitored by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorbance spectra. The method shows high sensitivity with detection limits of 1 × 10−9 M for visual detection and 1 × 10−11 M for UV–Vis analysis, which is far below the safety limit of melamine ingestion in infant formula (1 ppm = 7.9 × 10−6 M) and the detection limit acquired by most AuNP-based melamine detection methods. Good recoveries were obtained over the range of 94.7–95.5% with a relative standard deviation of mean recovery (RSD) ranging from 1.40 to 5.81. The method provides a simple, feasible, fast and real-time detection of melamine adulterants in infant formula by the naked eye, without the aid of advanced instruments.</jats:p>"

In the realm of molecular recognition, this cavity is used not only as a recognition site but also as a reaction medium, where a hydrophobic sensor recognizes a guest molecule. Based on the latter concept, we have designed a novel supramolecular sensing system composed of Zn(II)-dipicolylamine metal complex-based azobenzene (1-Zn) and 3A-amino-3A-deoxy-(2AS,3AS)-γ-cyclodextrin (3-NH2-γ-CyD) for sensing adenosine-5′-triphosphate (ATP). 1-Zn showed redshifts in the UV-Vis spectra and induced circular dichroism (ICD) only when both ATP and 3-NH2-γ-CyD were present. Calculations of equilibrium constants indicated that the amino group of 3-NH2-γ-CyD was involved in the formation of supramolecular 1-Zn/3-NH2-γ-CyD/ATP. The Job plot of the ICD spectral response revealed that the stoichiometry of 1-Zn/3-NH2-γ-CyD/ATP was 2:1:1. The pH effect was examined and 1-Zn/3-NH2-γ-CyD/ATP was most stable in the neutral condition. The NOESY spectrum suggested the localization of 1-Zn in the 3-NH2-γ-CyD cavity. Based on the obtained results, the metal coordination interaction of 1-Zn and the electrostatic interaction of 3-NH2-γ-CyD were found to take place for ATP recognition. The “reaction medium approach” enabled us to develop a supramolecular sensing system that undergoes multi-point interactions in water. This study is the first step in the design of a selective sensing system based on a good understanding of supramolecular structures.</jats:p>"

32212,"<jats:p>Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) is defined as a functional food as it contains numerous phenolic components with well-recognized health-beneficial properties, such as high antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity. These characteristics depend on their structural/conformational behavior, which is largely determined by intra- and intermolecular H-bond interactions. While the vibrational dynamics of isolated compounds have been studied in a number of recent investigations, their signal in a real-life sample of EVOO is overwhelmed by the major constituent acids. Here, we provide a full characterization of the vibrational spectroscopic signal from commercially available EVOO samples using Inelastic Neutron Scattering (INS) and Raman spectroscopies. The spectra are dominated by CH2 vibrations, especially at about 750 cm−1 and 1300 cm−1. By comparison with the spectra from hydroxytyrosol and other minor phenolic compounds, we show that the best regions in which to look for the structure–activity information related to the minor polar compounds is at 675 and 1200 cm−1 for hydroxytyrosol, and around 450 cm−1 for all minor polar compounds used as reference, especially if a selectively deuterated sample is available. The regional origin of the EVOO samples investigated appears to be related to the different amount of phenolic esters versus acids as reflected by the relative intensities of the peaks at 1655 and 1747 cm−1.</jats:p>"

The chemical composition and light absorption of 2D copper nanosheets are also studied. A new green method is mainly to utilize DMSO2, which is environmentally friendly enough to be considered a food-grade chemical, unlike the conventional method using toxic chemicals, such as ammonia and hydrazine (N2H4). With a reducing agent, the aggregation of uncertain copper products was produced in the absence of DMSO2, while 2D copper nanosheets were formed in the presence of DMSO2. The optimum concentration of DMSO2 as a surfactant was determined to be 2 M, resulting in large surface areas with regular edges. FTIR spectrum confirmed C–H bonding from DMSO2 used to synthesize 2D copper nanosheets. The light absorption peak was revealed at 800 nm in the UV–vis spectrum. This proposed new green method not only has a simpler process than the conventional methods, such as hydrothermal method and chemical bath deposition, but also substitutes toxic chemicals with DMSO2. 2D copper nanosheets can be used for various applications, including conductive filler or ink in the flexible electronics and laser photonics fields.</jats:p>"

The imine crystallized in the monoclinic P21/n space group with a = 18.9567(7) Å, b = 6.18597(17) Å, c = 22.5897(7) Å, and β = 114.009(4)°. Intermolecular interactions in the PPL9 crystal were only weak C−H⋯N hydrogen bonds investigated using the Hirshfeld surface. The electronic and geometric structure of the imine were investigated by the density functional theory and the time-dependent density-functional theory. The properties of the imine in neutral and protonated form with camforosulphonic acid (CSA) were investigated using cyclic voltammetry, UV–vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Theoretical and experimental studies showed that for the 1:1 molar ratio the protonation occured on nitrogen in pyridine in the PPL9 structure, as an effect of Brönsted acid–base interactions. Thermographic camera was used to defined defects in constructed simple devices with ITO/PPL9 (or PPL9:CSA)/Ag/ITO architecture.

The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac sodium was selected as a model drug and encapsulated into the pores of prepared supports. Materials were characterized by the combination of infrared spectroscopy (IR), atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photon cross-correlation spectroscopy (PCCS), nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis, thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SA-XRD) experiments. The drug release from prepared matrixes was realized in two model media differing in pH, namely small intestine environment/simulated body fluid (pH = 7.4) and simulated gastric fluid (pH = 2), and at different temperatures, namely normal body temperature (T = 37 °C) and inflammatory temperature (T = 42 °C). The process of drug loading into the pores of prepared materials from the diclofenac sodium salt solutions with different concentrations and subsequent quantitative determination of released drugs was analyzed by UV-VIS spectroscopy. Analysis of prepared SBA-15 materials modified with polyethylenimines in solution showed a high ability to store large amounts of the drug, up to 230 wt.%. Experimental results showed their high drug release into the solution at pH = 7.4 for both temperatures, which is related to the high solubility of diclofenac sodium in a slightly alkaline environment. At pH = 2, a difference in drug release rate was observed between both temperatures. Indeed, at a higher temperature, the release rates and the amount of released drug were 2–3 times higher than those observed at a lower temperature. Different kinetic models were used to fit the obtained drug release data to determine the drug release rate and its release mechanism. Moreover, the drug release properties of prepared compounds were compared to a commercially available medicament under the same experimental conditions.</jats:p>"

The vibrational spectra of tetraphenylporphine and its substituted complex were simulated to study the substitution effects of sulfonic acid group at the peripheral sites of tetraphenylporphine. Experimentally, vibrational properties of these molecules have been studied using infrared absorption spectroscopic technique. The vibrational frequencies obtained from the theoretical studies generally agree with the experimental values. For substituted molecules, due to a change in charge distribution, ring vibrations accompanied by the S–O motions also appear at the higher wavenumbers. In the lower region, C–H bending vibrations diminish and SO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> group vibrations arise. The electronic absorption spectra of the substituted tetraphenylporphine in different solvents have been studied using UV-vis spectroscopy. In addition to dipole-dipole and electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding plays a key role in molecular-solvent interactions. The energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and natural bonding orbital analysis show the intermolecular charge transfer interactions. The molecular electrostatic potential and solvent accessible surface area analysis were made in order to study the interaction sites of the molecules.

Active films were prepared from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) containing baicalin extract by casting method. The effect of baicalin extracts on the UV-blocking, optical, antioxidant property, water vapor permeability, swelling and mechanical properties of the films were studied. UV–vis transmittance spectra showed that PVA films incorporated with baicalin extract blocked ultraviolet light range from 280–400 nm even with low concentration of baicalin (0.5 wt%) and maintain the high transparency in visible spectrum. The outstanding UV-blocking properties of PVA films incorporated with baicalin extract were also confirmed by Rhodamine B degradation. Baicalin conferred antioxidant properties to PVA films as determined by DPPH radical scavenging activity. Due to the interaction between hydroxy groups of baicalin and PVA molecule, water vapor permeability, swelling and elongation at break of the films were decreased accompanied with the increasing in tensile strength and Young’s modulus. FTIR reveal that the interaction between PVA molecules was significant changed by the introduction of baicalin. These results suggest that PVA film incorporated with baicalin extract can be used for the development of functional protective film.</jats:p>"

Through visual confirmation and ultraviolet and visible (UV–Vis) spectrum analysis, we found that the biosynthesis of AgNPs was realized in the process in which biomass of B. licheniformis TT01 was incubated with AgNO3 solution. Obtained AgNPs were then assayed for antibacterial activity against three species of bacteria, namely Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Ralstoniasolanacearum, showing better inhibitory action than the AgNO3 solution and the bacterial extracellular fluid. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AgNP solution was 206 ppm against E. coli and R. solanacearum and 343.3 against B. cereus.

32382,"<jats:p>Graphene oxide (GO) exhibits different properties from those found in free-standing graphene, which mainly depend on the type of defects induced by the preparation method and post-processing. Although defects in graphene oxide are widely studied, we report the effect of drying time in GO and how this modifies the presence or absence of edge-, basal-, and sp3-type defects. The effect of drying time is evaluated by Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The traditional D, G, and 2D peaks are observed together with other less intense peaks called the D’, D*, D**, D+G, and G+D. Remarkably, the D* peak is activated/deactivated as a direct consequence of drying time. Furthermore, the broad region of the 2D peak is discussed as a function of its deconvoluted 2D1A, 2D2A, and D+G bands. The main peak in UV-visible absorption spectra undergoes a redshift as drying time increases. Finally, TEM measurements demonstrate the stacking of exfoliated GO sheets as the intercalated (water) molecules are removed.</jats:p>"

32384,"<jats:p>Laboratory simulation is the only feasible way to achieve Martian environmental conditions on Earth, establishing a key link between the laboratory and Mars exploration. The mineral phases of some Martian surface materials (especially hydrated minerals), as well as their spectral features, are closely related to environmental conditions. Therefore, Martian environment simulation is necessary for Martian mineral detection and analysis. A Mars environment chamber (MEC) coupled with multiple in situ spectral sensors (VIS (visible)-NIR (near-infrared) reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), and UV-VIS emission spectroscopy) was developed at Shandong University at Weihai, China. This MEC is a comprehensive research platform for Martian environmental parameter simulation, regulation, and spectral data collection. Here, the structure, function and performance of the MEC and the coupled spectral sensors were systematically investigated. The spectral characteristics of some geological samples were recorded and the effect of environmental parameter variations (such as gas pressure and temperature) on the spectral features were also acquired by using the in situ spectral sensors under various simulated Martian conditions. CO2 glow discharge plasma was generated and its emission spectra were assigned. The MEC and its tested functional units worked well with good accuracy and repeatability. China is implementing its first Mars mission (Tianwen-1), which was launched on 23 July 2020 and successfully entered into a Mars orbit on 10 February 2021. Many preparatory works such as spectral databases and prediction model building are currently underway using MECs, which will help us build a solid foundation for real Martian spectral data analysis and interpretation.</jats:p>"
32385,"<jats:p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the new [Ru(Q)(Cl)2(H2O)2] complex (RuIII/Q). A new vital complex containing quercetin flavonoid compound (Q) with ruthenium (III) ions was synthesized. The molar conductivity of the RuIII/Q complex was measured in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) with value 12 (Ω−1 mol−1 cm−1, indicating their non-electrolytic nature. Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic investigation of the RuIII/Q complex indicated that Q is coordinated as a bidentate with Ru metal ions through the oxygen of carbonyl C(4)=O group and oxygen of phenolic C(3)−O group based on the wavenumber shifts at 1654 and 1335 cm−1 respectively. The electronic (UV−Vis) spectra and the magnetic susceptibility value (1.85 B.M.) revealed that the Ru(III) complex has an octahedral geometry. The average diameter of the RuIII/Q nanoparticles was approximately 7–15 nm according to the transmission electron microscopy. The thermogravimetric study (TG/DTG) indicates that the RuIII/Q compound is quite stable until 300 °C. To assess biological activity, 60 male rats were allocated to six groups, namely control, DG (D-galactose), Q, RuIII/Q, DG plus Q, and DG plus RuIII/Q. Antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx, and GRx), markers of lipid peroxidation (such as MDA), expression of genes (namely Nrf2, Cu-ZnSOD, CAT, GPx, cyto c, P53, Bax, BCl2, caspase-3, and caspase-9 in testicular tissue), glutamate, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), GSH, HCY, amyloid beta, and GABA levels were evaluated in brain tissues. Cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-α, histological and ultrastructural studies were estimated in both the brain and testicular tissues, while the comet assay was performed in the brain tissue. RuIII/Q administration either alone or combined with DG reduced oxidative injury to normal levels and decreased apoptotic activities. Thus, RuIII/Q inhibited injury in both the testis and brain and reduced oxidative stress in male rats. The (RuIII/Q) complex has a potent ameliorative effect against aging neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, and antihepatic cancer activity induced by D-galactose (DG).</jats:p>"

The biosynthetic procedure was rapid and simple and was easily monitored via colour changes and ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. Subsequently, measurement of zeta potential (ZP), photon cross-correlation spectroscopy (PCCS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis were employed to characterise the as-synthesised nanoparticles. The XRD investigation confirmed the presence of Ag0 in the nanoparticles, and interactions between the bioactive compounds of the plants and the produced AgNPs were evident in the FTIR spectra. TEM indicated that the nanoparticles exhibited a bimodal size distribution, with the smaller particles being spherical and the larger having a truncated octahedron shape. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of the AgNPs was tested against five bacterial strains.

The main focus of the work was to optimize the conditions of ceftobiprole qualitative determination and to validate the developed procedure according to ICH guidelines. As a result of the optimization process, HPTLC Cellulose chromatographic plates as a stationary phase and a mixture consisting of ethanol:2-propanol: glacial acetic acid: water (4:4:1:3, v/v/v/v) as a mobile phase were chosen. The densitometric detection was carried out at maximum absorbance of ceftobiprole (λ = 232 nm). Next, the validation process of the developed procedure was carried out. The relative standard deviation (RSD) for precision was less than 1.65%, which proves the high compatibility of the results, as well as the LOD = 0.0257 µg/spot and LOQ = 0.0779 µg/spot values, which also confirm the high sensitivity of the procedure. The usefulness of the developed method for the stability studies of ceftobiprole was analyzed. Study was carried out under stress conditions, i.e., acid and alkaline environments, exposure to radiation imitating sunlight and high temperature (40–60 °C). It was found that cefotbiprole is unstable in an alkaline environment and during exposure to UV-VIS radiation.

In the preparation of the Zn2Ti3O8, the calcination temperature is a crucial parameter. Hence, in the present work, we aimed to synthesize the Zn2Ti3O8 materials from zinc(II) nitrate and titanium(IV) isopropoxide as precursors by using a sol-gel method and followed by calcination at 700, 900, and 1100 °C to give ZT-700, ZT-900, and ZT-100 materials, respectively. The ZT materials were characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DR UV-vis), and fluorescence spectroscopies. It was confirmed that the ZT materials contained O−Ti−O, Zn−O−Ti, Zn−O, Ti−O−Ti, and Ti−O functional groups as shown from their FTIR spectra. Similar fluorescence properties were only observed on the ZT-700 and ZT-900. From the bandgap energy analysis, ZT-700 and ZT-900 contained spinel and cubic Zn2Ti3O8 (spl-Zn2Ti3O8 and c-Zn2Ti3O8) crystal phases), while ZT-1100 contained c-Zn2TiO4 and TiO2 rutile crystal phases. The kinetic analysis of photocatalytic phenol degradation showed that both ZT-700 and ZT-900 materials exhibited high photocatalytic activity with the reaction rate constants of 0.0353 and 0.0355 h−1, respectively. These values were higher than that of the ZT-1100 (0.0206 h−1). This study demonstrated that calcination at 700 and 900 °C resulted in the formation of the spl-Zn2Ti3O8 and c-Zn2Ti3O8 phases, which were effective as the photocatalyst, but the formation of c-Zn2TiO4 and rutile TiO2 at calcination of 1100 °C deteriorated the photocatalytic activity.

The ICT complexes form distinct columnar liquid crystalline (LC) mesophases with well-defined alternating molecular alignment as demonstrated by UV-Vis-NIR spectra, IR spectra, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. These liquid crystalline ICT complexes display unique phase transitions in response to mechanical stress: the columnar ICT phase is converted to macroscopically oriented smectic-like mesophases upon applying shear force. Although there exist reports on the formation of ICT in the crystalline state, this study provides the first rational identification of ICT mesophases based on the spectroscopic and structural data. The liquid crystalline ICT phases are generated by strong electronic interactions between the liquid π-donors and solid acceptors. It clearly shows the significance of simultaneous fulfillment of strong π-donating ability and ordered self-assembly of the stable ICT pairs.

X-ray Diffractometer (XRD) study indicated a relatively lower variation with a higher dose of ions. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibited that with the implantation of Cu ions the intensity of existing bands decreases, while the result confirms the existence of a C=C group. The pristine and ion-implanted samples were also investigated using photoluminescence (PL) and Ultra Violet-Visible (UV-VIS) spectra. The optical band gap (Eg) was observed up to 3.05 eV for the implanted samples, while the pristine sample exhibited a wide energy-gap up to ~3.9 eV. The change in the optical gap indicated the presence of a gradual phase transition for the polymer blends. The dielectric measurements of the pristine and Cu-implanted PMMA were investigated in the 10 Hz to 2 GHz frequency range. It was found that the implanted samples showed a significant decrease in the value of the dielectric constant. The value of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss of the PMMA and Cu-implanted samples at a 1-kHz frequency were found to be ~300 and 29, respectively.

Oxoammonium cation (TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) is a high-potential oxidant for the selective oxidation of primary alcohols, with hydroxylamine (TEMPOH) as a side product. TEMPO or TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> has been widely applied for various reactions. However, the conversion mechanisms among TEMPO, TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and TEMPOH are not well understood and remain controversial, due to complications in the direct observation of the reactions. In this work, two-dimensional correlation (2D-COS) UV–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy is applied to examine the correlations between the characteristic bands of each species, to obtain insights into the complete reaction mechanisms. Series of dynamic UV–Vis spectra of solutions under different external perturbations (as a function of reaction time) were recorded and used in the generation of 2D-COS synchronous and asynchronous maps. The key UV–Vis band assignments are as follows: 250 nm and 400 nm for TEMPO, 290 nm and 480 nm for TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, and 200 nm and 315 nm for TEMPOH. The results indicate that the conversion between TEMPO and TEMPOH in acidic solution is a reversible process, which reaches an equilibrium state after two hours. However, the reaction becomes irreversible after three hours, due to a higher degree of irreversible protonation of TEMPOH to form TEMPOH-H<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>. Fast conversion from TEMPO to TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> is observed when sodium hypochlorite co-oxidant is added. The synproportionation–disproportionation also reaches an equilibrium. However, there is no evidence of the conversion from TEMPOH to TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> under the reaction conditions. At high reaction temperature, the formation of TEMPOH occurs first from TEMPO<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> decomposition, followed by TEMPO decomposition. These detailed mechanisms are beneficial in designing the optimum process conditions for the oxidation of specific alcohols. </jats:p>"

In this study, the pretreated diatomite (PD) with 5[Formula: see text]wt.% NaOH solution possessed better pore structure and large specific surface area. A facile hydrothermal-photoreduction method was adopted to prepare Bi/BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/PD composite. The chemical composition, microstructure morphology and pore structure of samples were investigated by means of XRF, XRD, SEM, TEM, EDS, XPS and BET methods. The results showed that the metallic Bi was uniformly deposited on the BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>. After loaded on PD, both surface area and total pore volume had a significant increase. In addition, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra presented that the absorption capacity of Bi/BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>/PD-25% composite in the visible light range was remarkably high due to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) caused by metallic Bi. From photoluminescence (PL) spectra and transient photocurrents, the heterojunction formed between Bi/BiVO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and PD helped promoting the separation and migration of photo-generated carriers, which in turn led to higher photocatalytic activity.

Suspended dust samples were collected across ten different stations in Nigeria; namely: Maiduguri (11º49'N, 13º09'E), Potiskum (11º43'N, 11º02'E), Bauchi (10º17'N, 09º 48'E), Jos (9º55'N, 8º55'E), Lafia (08º49'N, 07º50'E), Abuja (09º09'N, 07º11'E), Minna (9º36'N, 06º35'E), Ilorin (8º36'N, 4º 35'E), Oyo (8º12'N, 3º42'E) and Iwo (7º63'N, 4º19'E) and analyzed using Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The quantitative, qualitative and optical characterization analyses were carried out on all the samples collected across all the stations considered, in order to obtain the functional groups and some elements present in the samples. The FT-IR spectra peaks show that the transmittance waveband from 3337.8 cm-1 to 3291.2 cm-1 corresponds to the Hydroxyl group, H-bonded OH stretch in plane and out of plane bonds for all the stations considered. These bonds represent the presence of transition metals and unsaturated bonds found in the samples, which include K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mo, As, Zr, Pb, V, Sr, Cr and Ce. The samples collected across all stations have maximum UV absorbance peaks at around 210 nm waveband and weak visible light absorbance peaks (orange – red spectra) around 620 nm and 700 nm. The study concluded that the transmittance waveband, the waveband absorbance peaks and the elemental composition of the dust samples analyzed vary from station to station. This study will however recommend that further study be made for the purpose of environmental awareness.

               <jats:p>The paper discusses the effect of ionizing radiation on the functional properties of the biodegradable starch:PVA films. The analysis is related to the possible use of the material for packing the products (particularly, food) that are predicted for radiation decontamination and to the potential modification of the material by radiation treatment. Our previous results have shown that the influence of ionizing radiation on the films’ properties varied for the specific compositions (differing in starch:PVA ratio or the type of substrates) and depended on irradiation conditions. However, these studies considered only the irradiation performed in gamma chamber or in e-beam using a dose of 25 kGy. Therefore, the present study deals with the effect of the irradiations performed using various doses on the selected promising starch:PVA composition. The films characterized by starch:PVA weight ratio of 45:55 was obtained by solution casting and irradiated with fast electrons in air and with <jats:sup>60</jats:sup>Co gamma rays in nitrogen applying the doses of 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 50, and 75 kGy. No regular dependence has been noticed between the composition of films (differing in the starch and PVA content) and the intensities of the particular bands in the UV-VIS DRS spectra after irradiation. The results indicated strong interaction of the starch and PVA components in the films and the occurrence of specific reactions in each composition upon irradiation. No special differences were observed between tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the non-irradiated films characterized by the starch:PVA ratio equal to 45:55 and the samples irradiated using doses in the range of 5–75 kGy. Similarly, no differences were observed in both cases between the swelling capability of the non-irradiated and the irradiated films. However, it can be deduced that solubility in water increased when the radiation dose increased. The results show that using the doses till the range 25 kGy does not cause an essential change of all the examined properties of the starch:PVA (45:55) films. Accordingly, starch:PVA (45:55) films might be considered suitable for packing food predicted for radiation decontamination.</jats:p>"

Based on the characterization of SEM, FT-IR and XRD, it was found that the rod-like crystals of APT determined the size of MIL-101(Fe) while maintaining its regular octahedral crystal form, and the crystal size of MIL-101(Fe) in APT@MIL enlarged 4 times. It was also discovered that the rod-like APT were evenly distributed in MIL-101(Fe) crystals. Using APT@MIL as the photocatalyst, some organic dyes were photodegraded in simulated sunlight. The analysis indicated that APT@MIL has high adsorption and photodegradation activity, the removal rate of methylene blue was up to 99.5%. Finally, the photocatalytic activity of APT@MIL was verified by UV-Vis DRS, photoluminescence spectra.

First, SiO2 (150 nm) was prepared, modified by amino groups, and incubated by gold nanoparticles (ca. 3 nm Au metal nanoparticles (NPs)) to immobilize Au NPs to SiO2 surface. Then, Au NPs were grown on the prepared SiO2@Au seed by reducing chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) by ascorbic acid (AA) in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). The presence of bigger (ca. 20 nm) Au NPs on the SiO2 surface was confirmed by transmittance electronic microscopy (TEM) images, color changes to dark blue, and UV-vis spectra broadening in the range of 450 to 750 nm. The SiO2@Au nanostructure showed several advantages compared to the hydrofluoric acid (HF)-treated SiO2@Au, such as easy separation, surface modification stability by 11-mercaptopundecanoic acid (R-COOH), 11-mercapto-1-undecanol (R-OH), and 1-undecanethiol (R-CH3), and a better peroxidase-like catalysis activity for 5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reaction. The catalytic activity of SiO2@Au was two times better than that of HF-treated SiO2@Au. When SiO2@Au nanostructure was used as a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate, the signal of 4-aminophenol (4-ATP) on the surface of SiO2@Au was also stronger than that of HF-treated SiO2@Au.

We report the synthesis and scale-up of triangular silver nanoplates (TSNPs) and their integration into polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactic acid (PLA) polymers through a solvent-casting technique. The TSNPs have a high geometric aspect ratio and strong local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) response, which provides an effective tool for monitoring their integrity during processing and integration with the biodegradable plastics. An aqueous-based seed-mediated chemical method was used to synthesize the TSNPs, and characterisation was carried out using TEM and UV (Ultraviolet)-VIS (Visible) spectroscopy to measure LSPR profiles. The UV-VIS spectra of silver seeds and TSNPs exhibited characteristic peaks at 395 and 600 nm respectively. Synthesized TSNPs were coated with thiol-terminated polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG) and transferred into chloroform in order to effect compatibility with PCL and PLA. TSNP/PCL and TSNP/PLA composite films were prepared by solvent casting. The morphological structure, thermal, mechanical, and antimicrobial properties of the TSNP-incorporated composite films were evaluated. Results showed the TSNP-treated films had a rougher surface than the bare films. Insignificant changes in the thermal properties of TSNP-treated films compared to bare ones were also observed, which indicated the thermal stability of the composite films. The tensile strength and antimicrobial properties of the composite films were increased after TSNP incorporation. TSNP/PCL and TSNP/PLA films exhibited improved antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with antimicrobial effect (AE) values ranging between 0.10 and 0.35.

The resulting drug-loaded NFs (LNFs) were characterized physically using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry (for drug loading capacity (LC), drug encapsulation efficiency (EE), and drug release kinetics determination), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (for thermostability evaluation), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (for surface morphology analysis), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (for functional group identification). LNFs were further characterized biologically by in-vitro assessment of their potency against S. aureus clinical strains (N = 16) using the Kirby–Bauer test and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, by ex-vivo assessment to evaluate their cytotoxicity against primary human epidermal keratinocytes using MTT assay, and by in-vivo assessment to estimate their diabetic chronic wound-healing efficiency using NcZ10 diabetic/obese mice (N = 18). Thin and uniform NFs with a smooth surface and standard size (&lt;400 nm) were observed by SEM at the optimized 5:5 (GEL:PVA) volumetric ratio. FTIR analyses confirmed the drug loading into BNFs. Compared to free Ceph, LNFs were significantly more thermostable and exhibited sustained/controlled Ceph release. LNFs also exerted a significantly stronger antibacterial activity both in-vitro and in-vivo. LNFs were significantly safer and more efficient for bacterial clearance-induced faster chronic wound healing. LNF-based therapy could be employed as a valuable dressing material to heal S. aureus-induced chronic wounds in diabetic subjects.</jats:p>"

32771,"<jats:p>Abstract. Various instrumental or geophysical artifacts, such as
saturation, stray light or obstruction of light (either coming from the
instrument or related to solar eclipses), negatively impact satellite
measured ultraviolet and visible Earthshine radiance spectra and downstream
retrievals of atmospheric and surface properties derived from these spectra.
In addition, excessive noise such as from cosmic-ray impacts, prevalent
within the South Atlantic Anomaly, can also degrade satellite radiance
measurements. Saturation specifically pertains to observations of very
bright surfaces such as sunglint over open water or thick clouds. When
saturation occurs, additional photoelectric charge generated at the
saturated pixel may overflow to pixels adjacent to a saturated area and be
reflected as a distorted image in the final sensor output. When these
effects cannot be corrected to an acceptable level for science-quality
retrievals, flagging of the affected pixels is indicated. Here, we introduce
a straightforward detection method that is based on the correlation, r, between
the observed Earthshine radiance and solar irradiance spectra over a 10 nm
spectral range; our decorrelation index (DI for brevity) is simply
defined as a DI of 1−r. DI increases with anomalous additive effects or excessive
noise in either radiances, the most likely cause in data from the Ozone
Monitoring Instrument (OMI), or irradiances. DI is relatively
straightforward to use and interpret and can be computed for different
wavelength intervals. We developed a set of DIs for two spectral channels of
the OMI, a hyperspectral pushbroom imaging spectrometer. For each OMI
spatial measurement, we define 14 wavelength-dependent DIs within the OMI
visible channel (350–498 nm) and six DIs in its ultraviolet 2 (UV2) channel
(310–370 nm). As defined, DIs reflect a continuous range of deviations of
observed spectra from the reference irradiance spectrum that are
complementary to the binary saturation possibility warning (SPW) flags
currently provided for each individual spectral or spatial pixel in the OMI
radiance data set. Smaller values of DI are also caused by a number of
geophysical factors; this allows one to obtain interesting physical results
on the global distribution of spectral variations.

The electrochemical behavior of ceftriaxone was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and constant current density electrolysis assisted by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Cyclic voltammetry highlighted that the addition of CFTX in sodium halide solutions leads to significant changes in the hysteresis characteristics due to specific interactions with active species from electrolytes, as well as with the platinum electrode surface. After CV, when an exterior electric stimulus in short time (40 s) was applied, the UV-Vis spectra illustrated that CFTX is stable in the presence of F− ions, it is electro(degraded/transformed) in the presence of Cl− and Br− ions and interacts instantly with I− species. Electrolysis at constant current density confirms the results obtained from cyclic voltammetry, showing that (i) in the presence of fluoride ions CFTX gradually decomposes, but not completely, in about 60 min, without identifying a reaction product; (ii) chloride and bromide ions determine the almost complete CFTX electro(degradation/transformation) in 10 and 5 min, respectively, with completion of the electro-transformation reaction after 60 and 30 min, respectively; (iii) instantaneous interactions between CFTX and the iodide ions occurred.</jats:p>"

The obtained UV-Vis spectra was used to measure band gap energy of as-prepared SnFe2O4 NPs. XRD confirmed the spinel structure of NPs, while SEM and TEM analyses disclosed the size of NPs in the range of 15–50 nm and revealed the spherical shape of NPs. Moreover, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and BET analysis was carried out to estimate elemental composition and specific surface area, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity of the synthesized NPs were studied on normal (HUVEC, HEK293) and cancerous (A549) human cell lines. HUVEC cells were resistant to SnFe2O4 NPs; while a significant decrease in the viability of HEK293 cells was observed when treated with higher concentrations of SnFe2O4 NPs. Furthermore, SnFe2O4 NPs induced dramatic cytotoxicity against A549 cells. For in vivo study, rats received SnFe2O4 NPs at dosages of 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg. The 10 mg/kg dose increased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine compared to the controls (P &lt; 0.05). The pathology showed necrosis in the liver, heart, and lungs, and the greatest damages were related to the kidneys. Overall, the in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that SnFe2O4 NPs at high doses had toxic effects on lung, liver and kidney cells without inducing toxicity to HUVECs.

The present work reports low-cost phytofabrication of zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs employing aqueous extracts of various parts (leaves, stems, and inflorescences) of Tephrosia purpurea (T. purpurea). The formation, structure, morphology, and other physicochemical properties of ZnO NPs were characterized by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). UV–Vis spectral analysis revealed sharp surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at around 250–280 nm, while the XRD patterns confirmed distinctive peaks indices to the crystalline planes of hexagonal wurtzite ZnO NPs. TEM analysis confirmed the presence of spherical-shaped ZnO NPs with average particle sizes (PS) between 25–35 nm, which was in agreement with the XRD results. FTIR analysis revealed that phenolics, flavonoids, amides, alkaloids, and amines present in the plant extract are responsible for the stabilization of the ZnO NPs. Further, the hydrodynamic diameter in the range of 85–150 nm was measured using the DLS technique. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) ability of biogenic ZnO NPs was evaluated, and the highest efficiency was found in ZnO NPs synthesized via T. purpurea inflorescences extract. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of biogenic ZnO NPs showed three emission peaks consisting of a UV–Vis region with high-intensity compared to that of chemically synthesized ZnO NPs. The biosynthesized ZnO NPs showed photocatalytic activity under solar irradiation by enhancing the degradation rate of methylene blue (MB). Among the prepared biogenic ZnO NPs, T. purpurea leaves mediated with NPs acted as the most effective photocatalyst, with a maximum degradation efficiency of 98.86% and a half-life of 84.7 min.

32810,"<jats:p>Kaempferol is a flavonoid that occurs in tea and in many vegetables and fruits, including broccoli, cabbage, beans, grapes, apples, and strawberries. The efficacy of Kaempferol has been demonstrated in the treatment of breast, esophageal, cervical, ovarian, and liver cancers and leukemia, which very likely arises from its prooxidant properties and the activation of pro-apoptotic pathways. Indeed, this matter has already been the focus of a number of published studies and reviews. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the antioxidant vs. prooxidant properties of flavonoids in the presence of the redox-active metal, copper (II) ion, by means of the Fenton reaction. The specific motivation of this work is that, since an increased level of Cu(II) ions is known to be associated with many disease states such as neurological conditions (Alzheimer’s disease) and cancer, any interaction between these ions and flavonoids might affect the outcome of therapeutic uses of the latter. The structure of the Cu-kaempferol complex in DMSO was investigated by means of low temperature EPR spectroscopy, which confirmed the existence of at least two distinct coordination environments around the copper (II) ion. UV vis-spectra of kaempferol and its Cu(II) complex in DMSO revealed an interaction between the 5-OH (A ring) group and the 4-CO (C ring) group of kaempferol with Cu(II) ions. An ABTS assay confirmed that kaempferol acted as an effective radical scavenger, and that this effect was further enhanced in the form of the Cu(II)-kaempferol complex. Quantitative EPR spin trapping experiments, using DMPO as the spin trap, confirmed suppression of the formation of a mixture of hydroxyl, superoxide, and methyl radicals, in a Fenton reaction system, upon coordination of kaempferol to the redox-active Cu(II) ions, by 80% with respect to the free Cu(II) ions. A viscometric study revealed a better DNA-intercalating ability of the Cu-kaempferol complex than for free kaempferol, essential for conferring anticancer activity of these substances. The results of the viscometric measurements were compared with those from a DNA damage study of Cu-kaempferol complexes in a Fenton reaction system, using gel electrophoresis. At low concentrations of kaempferol (Cu–kaempferol ratios of 1:1 and 1:2), a very weak protective effect on DNA was noted, whereas when kaempferol was present in excess, a significant DNA-protective effect was found. This can be explained if the weakly intercalated kaempferol molecules present at the surface of DNA provide protection against attack by ROS that originate from the Fenton reaction involving intercalated Cu(II)-kaempferol complexes. Following the application of ROS scavengers, L-histidine, DMSO, and SOD, gel electrophoresis confirmed the formation of singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide radical anions, respectively. We propose that the prooxidant properties of Cu-kaempferol complexes may provide anticancer activity of these substances. When present in excess, kaempferol displays antioxidant properties under Cu-Fenton conditions. This suggests that kaempferol might prove a suitable candidate for the prevention or treatment of oxidative stress related medical conditions that involve a disturbed metabolism of redox metals such as copper, for example, Menkes disease, and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. For the potential use of kaempferol in clinical practice, it will be necessary to optimize the dose size and critical age of the patient so that this flavonoid may be beneficial as a preventive drug against cancer and neurological disorders.</jats:p>"
32811,"<jats:p>Fluorescence (excitation-emission matrices, EEMs) spectroscopy coupled with PARAFAC (parallel factor) modelling and UV-Vis (ultraviolet visible) spectra were used to ascertain the sources, distribution and biogeochemical transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the Duliujian River catchment.

Four fluorescent components, namely terrestrial humic acid (HA)-like (A/C), terrestrial fulvic acid (FA)-like (A/M), autochthonous fulvic acid (FA)-like (A/M), and protein-like substances (Tuv/T), were identified using EEM-PARAFAC modelling in this river catchment. The results demonstrated that terrestrial HA-like substances enhance its contents in summer ARE compared with BRE, whilst terrestrial FA-like substances were newly input in summer ARE, which was entirely absent upstream and downstream, suggesting that rain events could significantly input the terrestrial soil-derived DOM in the ambient downward catchments. Autochthonous FA-like substances in summer BRE could derive from phytoplankton in the downstream waters. The results also showed that DOM from wetland exhibited lower fluorescent intensity of humic-like peak A/C and fulvic-like peak A/M, molecular weight (SR) and humification index (HIX) during the low-flow season. Built-up land, cropland, and unused land displayed higher a335 (CDOM). A higher proportion of forest and industrial land in the SCs showed higher SUVA254 values. Humic-like moiety, molecular weight and aromaticity were more responsive to land use during stormflow in summer. Rainfall could increase the export of soil DOM from cropland and unused land, which influences the spatial variation of HIX. The results in this study highlighted that terrestrial DOM has a significant influence on the biogeochemical alterations of DOM compositions and thus water quality in the downward watershed catchments, which might significantly vary according to the land-use types and their alterations by human activities.</jats:p>"

32813,"<jats:p>This paper presents the results of a study of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films irradiated with Ar and Kr ions at both normal orientation and an angle of 40° to the normal. Normal irradiation was performed using Ar8+ and Kr15+ ions with an energy of 1.75 MeV/au and fluences in the range (2–500) × 1010 cm−2 for Ar8+ ions and (1.6 − 6.5) × 1010 cm−2 for Kr15+ ions. Kr ions with an energy of 1.2 MeV/au and charges of 13+, 14+, and 15+ were used for angled irradiation. For each Kr ion charge value, three fluence values were used: 5 × 1010, 1 × 1011, and 2.5 × 1011 cm−2. It is well known that irradiation of PET films by swift heavy ions results in a red shift of the UV-vis transmission spectra absorption edge. The experimental transmission spectra exhibit well-defined interference fringes, which obscure the underlying transmission response. Using an existing technique to obtain interference-free transmission curves Tα(λ) for both pristine and irradiated PET film samples, we found that S, the total radiation-induced absorption of light by the PET film, is proportional to the logarithm of the fluence F. In addition to this dependence on the irradiating fluence, we also found that the charge of the irradiating ion has a significant influence on the position of the absorption edge in the UV-vis spectra. This provides experimentally independent evidence to confirm our previous results showing that ion charge has an effect on the post-irradiation state of PET films. We present a physical interpretation of the observed absorption edge red shift in irradiated PET films as being due to the growth of extended conjugated systems via the formation of intermolecular helical structures. Our investigations into the stability of irradiation-induced effects in PET films show that comparison of UV-vis transmission spectra before and after annealing can provide information about the structure of deep traps in PET.</jats:p>"

The obtained results showed that the combination of orange essential oil with trehalose decreases the transmittance value in the UV and Vis regions (up to 0.14% ± 0.02% at 356 nm), meaning that produced films can act as a UV protector. Most produced films in the research were resistant to Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus), though most films did not show antibacterial properties against Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts.

The corresponding DFT computational studies are in a good agreement with the experimental results and prove the presence of 1:2 host-guest complex as the major component in the solution (97.7%), but its optimized geometry differs from that observed in the solid-state. The UV-Vis and CD spectra simulated by using the solution-state geometry and the TD-DFT/ωB97X-D/cc-pVDZ + SMD (CH2Cl2) level of theory reproduced the experimentally obtained UV-Vis and CD spectra and confirmed the difference between the solid-state and solution structures. Moreover, it was shown that CD spectrum is very sensitive to the spatial arrangement of porphyrin subunits.</jats:p>"

Here, we expand this traditional usage with the green biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) achieved using a Carissa carandas L. leaf extract as a reducing and capping agent. The green synthesis of AgNPs reaction was carried out using 1mM silver nitrate and leaf extract. The effect of temperature on the synthesis of AgNPs was examined using room temperature (25 °C) and 60 °C. The silver nanoparticles were formed in one hour by stirring at room temperature. In this case, a yellowish brown colour was developed. The successful formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by UV–Vis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The characteristic peaks of the UV-vis spectrum and XRD confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. The biosynthesised AgNPs showed potential antioxidant activity through DPPH assay. These AgNPs also exhibited potential antibacterial activity against human pathogenic bacteria. The results were compared with the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the plant extract, and clearly suggest that the green biosynthesized AgNPs can constitute an effective antioxidant and antibacterial agent.</jats:p>"

32852,"<jats:p>Synthesis of conjugates of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) with chlortriazine reactive dyes (RD) has been developed.  The obtained CNC-RD conjugates were characterized using a complex of modern methods: UV-Vis, IR and 13C solid state NMR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric and elemental analysis, particle size and zeta potential analysis, scanning electron and polarization optical microscopy. IR spectra of CNC-RD films show absorption bands typical of cellulose. The formation of a covalent cellulose-dye bond is confirmed by the presence of characteristic absorption bands of the resulting ether bond in the region of 1000-1300 cm-1. Based on the analysis of solid-state 13C NMR spectra, it was concluded that the degree of crystallinity of the CNC-RD conjugates does not change compared to the CNC, i.e. the RD covalently bind to the surface of the CNC particles and do not affect the crystal structure of the CNC. Using a simple model of CNC with square cross-section, and based on the elemental analysis data, the amount of covalently bound dye on the surface of CNC particles was estimated. The results obtained allow us to conclude that covalent bound of RD occurs selectively at one of the ends of the cellulose nanocrystal (the so-called reducing end of the cellulose polymer chain). Successful CNC surface modification is confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. It was found that aqueous suspensions of CNC-RD conjugates have indicator properties. The sizes and charges of the particles of CNC-RD conjugates in dilute aqueous suspensions were determined. High colloidal stability of the CNC-RD aqueous suspensions was confirmed. It has been shown that CNC-RD colloidal suspensions possess liquid crystalline properties, which is clearly demonstrated by their iridescent color in polarized light with stirring. CNC films modified with RD also possess birefringence properties and exhibit an iridescent color in polarized light. The morphology of CNC-RD particles was studied using scanning electron microscopy.

Multi-responsive materials have received extensive interest in many areas due to their smart characteristics. This paper presents rationally designed multi-responsive spherical polyelectolyte brushes composed of a solid polystyrene (PS) core and a poly (2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) shell synthesized by photoemulsion polymerization. Based on dynamic light scattering, Zeta potential, turbidity measurements, isothermal titration calorimetry, and UV-vis spectroscopy, PS-PDMAEMA works as a good potential adsorbent for bovine serum albumin (BSA) for which the maximum adsorption capability could reach up to 5190mg g−1. Moreover, the immobilization and release of protein on the polymer brush could be adjusted with different triggers, including the pH, ionic strength, and temperature. Furthermore, the green gas triggers, CO2 and N2, could be employed in the BSA@ PS-PDMAEMA system by easily bubbling over many cycles without any salt accumulation. The main reason for the observed actions is the brushes could be switched alternately between extended and collapsed states with different stimulations. Upon comparing the circular dichroism spectra of original and released BSA after many cycles of adsorption and release, it’s clear that the protein can retain its initial biological activity after release from the PS-PDMAEMA. This work provides an effective and green way to immobilize and release proteins in biotechnology.

In addition, they also can avoid many problems related to traditional materials such as toxic chemical residues or brittleness. With the fast development of cutting-edge flexible materials and bioelectronics processing technologies, the market for biocompatible materials with extremely high or low thermal conductivity is growing rapidly. The thermal conductivity of protein films, which is usually on the order of 0.1 W/m·K, can be rather tunable as the value for stretched protein fibers can be substantially larger, outperforming that of many synthetic polymer materials. These findings indicate that the thermal conductivity and the heat transfer direction of protein-based materials can be finely controlled by manipulating their nano-scale structures. This review will focus on the structure of different fibrous proteins, such as silks, collagen and keratin, summarizing factors that can influence the thermal conductivity of protein-based materials and the different experimental methods used to measure their heat transfer properties.</jats:p>"

This study focuses on evaluating thermal conductivity of controlled low strength material (CLSM) made entirely from by-products (e.g., coal ash, gypsum, red mud). In the experimental program, pond ash is used as a full replacement of natural sand whereas fly ash activated by a little lime, red mud, and gypsum is the main binder in the production of CLSM. Various laboratory tests including flowability, bleeding, initial setting time, and unconfined compressive strength were performed on the prepared CLSM mixtures to determine its general characteristics. Thermal conductivity is then measured subjected to saturated curing condition (SC) and room temperature curing condition (RTC). As a result, all general characteristics meet the specification of CLSM reported in ACI 229R by controlling the ratio of gypsum to red mud. In particular, the good flowability of higher than 20 cm is observed as the G/Rm ratio of smaller than 1.33. The bleeding values, ranging from 0.30% to 2.70%, fall into the bleeding requirement of CLSM of less than 5%. Moreover, the initial setting time and strength results are also in the acceptable specification of general CLSM in ACI 229R. Eventually, the thermal conductivity of the proposed CLSM was in the range of 0.84–0.87 (W/mK) and these values were considerably affected by the saturation states and curing conditions rather than binder proportion.</jats:p>"

Pushing the nanostructure sizes down to the length scale dictated by electron MFPs, however, has hitherto been overlooked as it inevitably sacrifices electrical conduction. Here we report through ab initio simulations that Dirac material can overcome this limitation. The monotonically decreasing trend of the electron MFP allows filtering of long-MFP electrons that are detrimental to the Seebeck coefficient, leading to a dramatically enhanced power factor. Using SnTe as a material platform, we uncover this MFP filtering effect as arising from its unique nonparabolic Dirac band dispersion.

With X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), researchers characterized the phase structure and morphology of all the samples. The oxidation states of manganese were determined by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The role of Ca-site dual doping in the TE properties was also investigated. Increasing the Pr and Yb contents leads to decreases in the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient, leading to a power factor of 3.48 × 10−4 W·m−1·K−2 for x = 0.04 at 773 K, which is its maximum. Furthermore, the thermal conductivity (κ) decreases with increasing x, and κ = 1.26 W m−1·K−1 is obtained for x = 0.04 at 973 K.

The system has the advantages of no moving parts, made of solid state, operable over large working temperature difference, and can be formed into very small size. The operation of the device is numerically modeled considering the three major parametric effects: EC operation as a function of time, electric current applied on TE, and temperature difference between the hot and cold sinks. The results on coefficient of performance (COP) and heat flow per unit area are discussed.

The poor polycrystal bulk performance is attributed to traces of tin oxides covering the surface of SnSe powders, which increases thermal conductivity, reduces electrical conductivity and thereby reduces ZT.

Recently, a variety of new materials have emerged in the microelectronics industry with properties superior to Silicon, enabling new devices with extreme performance. Such materials include β-Gallium-oxide (β-Ga2O3), and black phosphorus (BP), which are acknowledged to have anisotropic thermal conductivity tensors. In many of these devices, thermal issues due to self-heating are a problem that affects the performance, efficiency, and reliability of the devices. Analytical solutions to the heat conduction equation in such devices with anisotropic thermal conductivity tensor offer significant computational savings over numerical methods. In this paper, general analytical solutions for the temperature distribution and the thermal resistance of a multilayered orthotropic system are obtained. The system is considered as a multilayered three-dimensional (3D) flux channel consisting of N-layers with different thermal conductivities in the three spatial directions in each layer. A single eccentric heat source is considered in the source plane while a uniform heat transfer coefficient is considered along the sink plane. The solutions account for the effect of interfacial conductance between the layers and for considering multiple eccentric heat sources in the source plane. For validation purposes, the analytical results are compared with numerical solution results obtained by solving the problem with the finite element method (FEM) using the ANSYS commercial software package.</jats:p>"

One of the difficulties in experimentally characterizing MMT-TIMs however, is distinguishing the bulk thermal resistance of the MMT-TIM from the thermal contact resistance that exists where it contacts the test apparatus.  Since these materials are highly electrically conductive, this study attempts to employ electrical contact resistance measurements to estimate their thermal contact resistance.  Tests using flat silver and gold specimens of known bulk thermal conductivity were used to develop a correlation between electrical and thermal contact resistance.  This relationship was then employed to estimate the thermal contact resistance of a prototype silver MMT-TIM and indicates the thermal contact resistance accounts for approximately 10% of the measured thermal contact resistance.

33500,"<jats:p>This paper provides an update on work at Penn State University on advanced thermal interface material (TIM) and attachment technology. The TIM concept consists of a “Low Melting Temperature Alloy” (LMTA) bonded to a thin copper substrate. The present work includes analytical modeling to separate the interface resistance (Rint) into “material” and “contact” resistance. Modeling indicates that contact resistance accounts for 1/3 of the interface resistance (Rint). Additional alloys have been identified that have thermal conductivity approximately three-times those identified in the previous 2002 publication. Thermal degradation of the LMTA TIM was also observed in the present work after extended thermal cycling above the melting point of the alloy. Possible mechanisms for this degradation are oxidation and contamination of the alloy layer rather than the inter-metallic diffusion.

33512,"<jats:p>The effects of heat treatment and sintering additives on the thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity of fine-grained SiC materials were investigated. The thermal conductivity and the electrical resistivity of dense SiC materials were measured at room temperature by a laser flash technique and a current-voltage method, respectively. The results indicated that the thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity of the SiC materials were dependent on the sintering additives and the resultant microstructure. Annealed materials with oxide additives developed microstructures consisting of elongated grains of various α/β–SiC polytypes. In contrast, annealed materials with oxynitride additives had microstructures consisting of fine equiaxed grains entirely of β–SiC phase. For the annealed materials with oxide additives the observed thermal conductivity was over 110 W/mK. For the annealed materials with oxynitride additives the observed value was 47 W/mK. The electrical resistivity of a hot-pressed material with oxide sintering additives decreased after annealing. For annealed materials with oxynitride additives, the electrical resistivity was even lower. High-resolution electron microscopy revealed a thin amorphous phase along the grain boundaries. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy results showed that there was segregation of both Al and O atoms and a very small amount of Y atoms at grain boundaries. The results indicated that the chemistry and structure of the grain boundary has significant influence on thermal and electrical properties in SiC.</jats:p>"

33634,"<jats:p> HCFC-141b blown rigid foams have now been used successfully for a couple of years in North America as insulation in refrigerated home appliances. Manufacturers have had time to adjust to the differences in processing between these systems and the CFC-11 systems that they replaced. Many appliance manufacturers have now focused their interest on foams that will provide lower cost without sacrificing properties or processing characteristics. </jats:p><jats:p> Although there are a number of ways to reduce cost, one of the best ways is to reduce the density of the foam. Bayer Corporation has previously reported on low density HCFC-141b appliance foam which had similar densities to CFC-11 foams of around 1.9 to 2.0 pounds per cubic foot (pcf). These foams had somewhat higher k-factors but still were successful in replacing some of the CFC-11 foams commercially. Other HCFC-141b foam systems were developed that gave equivalent or lower k-factor foams but at somewhat higher densities. These systems replaced most of the commercial CFC-11 systems. </jats:p><jats:p> Thermal conductivity of rigid polyurethane foams is to a large extent affected by the blowing agent, the closed cell content, cell size and the density. It has been reported that there exists a minimum thermal conductivity in the density range of around 2 to 3 pcf for CFC-11 blown foams. This appears to be true also for HCFC-141b foams, although the density range may be slightly different or narrower. It is not easy to reduce the density below 2 pcf without increasing the k-factor of the foam. Around or below 2 pcf, the increase in k-factor is caused not only by an increase in the radiation contribution to thermal conductivity due to coarser cells but to higher open cell content and possible convection currents within the cells. Since strength properties are also affected by density. There is a need by developers and manufacturers to evaluate long term dimensional stability of lower density foams. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper will discuss the development of new low density HCFC-141b appliance foams which have similar k-factors compared to the majority of commercial appliance foam systems in the 2.1 to 2.2 pcf range. These new systems will also be shown to have substantially lower k-factors with only a slight increase in density compared to a commercial system in the 1.9 to 2.0 pcf range. In addition, physical properties and processing characteristics of these foams will be compared to commercial foams. </jats:p>"

33638,"<jats:p> In 1989, industry produced some experimental, permeably-faced polyisocyanurate (PIR) laminated board insulation blown with HCFC-141b and a second batch blown with CFC-11, which has undergone continuous field thermal performance monitoring for 5.5 years (June 1989 until February 1995). From these boards, several thin-sliced specimens were prepared and laboratory k-factors periodically measured on these core foam specimens. This work was conducted as part of a six-year joint research project between The Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. (SPI). Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers Association (PIMA), National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA), and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). One of the major research products from this cooperative research effort was the development of an accelerated method for predicting full thickness lifetime thermal conductivities (""in-service R-values"") of permeably-faced polyisocyanurate products. This paper compares the prediction of the field installed permeably-faced boards generated from the accelerated aging procedure to the actual measured field performance. The field applications consist of loose-laid boards under ethylene propylene diene terpolymer (EPDM) membranes in a low-sloped roof installed in the ORNL Roof Thermal Research Apparatus (RTRA). For the 5.5 years, each test roof was monitored hourly for temperature and heat flux. This data provides a time series of boundary conditions for a computer program PROPOR ( Properties— Oak Ridge) to compute weekly thermal conductivities. PROPOR is an application of one-dimensional inverse heat transfer analysis. Every six months the test specimens were pulled from the roof and tested under steady state conditions in the laboratory according in American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) C 518-91. This field validation of an accelerated aging procedure concludes that the thin slicing and laboratory k-factor measurements, within the first six months, accurately predict five years of full thickness, in-situ thermal performance of HCFC-141b permeably-faced polyisocyanurate insulation boards. A computer program was developed which uses the thin slice data set of a specific manufacturer's insulation. The design service life and full product thickness is input, and the in-service R-value is estimated. This value will vary depending on results from the thin slice testing. This work is leading toward an acceptable industry standard to determine the in-service R-value, which is defined as the design thermal resistance of insulation over the normal life of a roof system containing foams which thermally age. At the National Roof Contractors Association 110th Annual Convention Feb. 4, 1997 in Orlando, Florida, the Polyisocyanurate Insulation Manufacturers announced that by January 1, 1998 each PIMA member-insulation manufacturer would have available aged thermal performance data. </jats:p>"

It is often assumed that thermoset materials in general, and polyurethanes specifically, are not recyclable or only recyclable in limited applications as regrind. Herein, we report the recyclability of polyurethane materials by glycolysis and recovery of a polyol. The glycolysis technology utilized is unique in that the residual free amine content is very low, and the entire reaction mixture is useful as a urethane polyol. This is in contrast to other glycolysis technologies that involve separation steps and ultimately in the production of other more hazardous waste streams. The reaction proceeds at ambient pressure and moderate temperature obviating the need for highly sophisticated control mechanisms. The recyclate properties are relatively insensitive to the waste stream utilized, thus permitting the mixed waste streams as raw materials in the process. </jats:p><jats:p> In this investigation, high density non-cellular rigid urethanes have been successfully glycolyzed and formulated into a variety of polyurethane systems.

33665,"<jats:p>Forced flow of air over extended surfaces offers a simple, reliable, and effective heat removal mechanism and is often employed in electronic equipment. The IBM 4381 heat sink, used in production IBM computers, utilizes this cooling technique. This heat sink consists of a ceramic substrate on which fins made of an aluminum-copper alloy are arranged in a regular array. Cooling air enters the fin array from a nozzle. Extensive experiments have been carried out to characterize the performance of this heat sink at the Advanced Thermal Engineering Laboratory at IBM Endicott. This paper presents computational analysis of the three-dimensional flow and heat transfer in this device for two different air flow rates through the nozzle. The heat dissipated by the electronic components is conducted into the fins through the ceramic base. In the present study the ceramic base is assumed to be subjected to a uniform heat flux at the bottom. The computational method incorporates a special block-correction procedure to enable iterative solution of conjugate heat transfer in the presence of large differences in thermal conductivities of the air and the fin material. The results of computations reproduce the flow pattern in the fin array that is observed experimentally. The part of the ceramic base directly below the nozzle is well cooled with the temperatures gradually increasing from the center towards the corner. The predicted pressure drop and most of the local temperatures at the base and the tip of the fins agree well with the experimental observations. This study illustrates the utility of computational flow analysis in the analysis and design of electronic cooling techniques.</jats:p>"

A wide range of intermediate bonding materials are used, for example glasses, oxide mixtures, and active metals. In this paper, the indirect-bonded metallization of AIN will be reviewed and discussed. Requirements which must be considered in producing successful metallizations include; wetting of the substrate and the metal by the intermediate phase and the reactivity between the intermediate phase and the substrate.

This paper describes the results of laboratory studies on various aspects of this application such as maintenance of insulation efficiency, corrosion protection, and friability. </jats:p><jats:p> Comparisons between thermal insulation systems on 3-inch pipe in -320°F service showed that a system employing slightly over one inch thickness of polyurethane rigid foam was more efficient than a system employing six inches of cellular glass. Because of the thickness-area geometry of pipe insulation, low-conductivity polyurethane rigid foam offers greater insulation advantages on small pipes than on essentially flat surfaces. </jats:p><jats:p> Studies of unprotected polyurethane rigid foam installed on a vessel maintained at —109°F and exposed to surroundings at 74° F and 50 percent relative humidity for a period of 200 days. The one inch thick specimens had K-factors averaging 0.21 after 200 days; thicker specimens resulted in progressively smaller K-factor increase. These results are attrib uted to an expected decrease in water vapor permeability through polymer films at low temperatures, and the formation of a frost barrier at the 32° F level within the foam. </jats:p><jats:p> Some conditions of service can result in corrosion of metal in contact with insulation, and such situations should be identified and handled with protective measures. When the metal was foamed in place or embedded in foam, the effect of foam on stainless steel, aluminum, galvanized iron, and copper appeared protective rather than corrosive; mild steel seemed adversely affected by foam contact. When the metal formed the faces of sandwich panels, foams poured in place tended to protect mild steel for about seven months, but did not appear to protect aluminum. When aluminum foamed in place was exposed to an environment which pro moted condensation of water at the aluminum surface where it could leach corrosive constituents from the foam, significant corrosion was observed within 3 months. A wash primer coating provided complete protection, but coal tar and modified acrylic latex coatings failed to provide any significant protection. </jats:p><jats:p> The friability of thermal insulation materials is a factor in their dura bility and their potential for health hazards due to dust inhalation. Fria bility tests of various materials showed that commercially available rigid cellular plastics were less friable than cellular glass. </jats:p>"
33808,"<jats:p>Open pore metal foams make efficient heat exchanger because of their high thermal conductivity and low permeability. This study describes a novel method of using wire-arc spraying to deposit Inconel 625 skins on the surface of sheets of 10 and 20 pores per linear inch nickel foam. The skins adhere strongly to the foam struts, giving high heat-transfer rates. Tests were done to determine the hydraulic and thermal characteristics of the heat exchangers and correlations developed to calculate Fanning friction factor and Nusselt number as a function of Reynolds number for airflow through the foam. Measured heat-transfer coefficients for the foam heat exchangers are greater than those of straight flow channels at the same flow rate. A ceramic thermal barrier coating was deposited on one face of the heat exchanger using plasma spraying. The coating and heat exchanger survived prolonged exposure to the flame of a methane-air burner.</jats:p>"
33809,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Suspension plasma spraying (SPS) and plasma spray-physical vapor deposition (PS-PVD) are the only thermal spray technologies shown to be capable of producing TBCs with columnar microstructures similar to the electron beam-physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) process but at higher deposition rates and relatively lower costs. The objective of this study was to achieve fundamental understanding of the effect of different columnar microstructures produced by these two thermal spray processes on their insulation and lifetime performance and propose an optimized columnar microstructure. Characterization of TBCs in terms of microstructure, thermal conductivity, thermal cyclic fatigue lifetime and burner rig lifetime was performed. The results were compared with TBCs produced by the standard thermal spray technique, atmospheric plasma spraying (APS). Bondcoats deposited by the emerging high-velocity air fuel (HVAF) spraying were compared to the standard vacuum plasma-sprayed (VPS) bondcoats to investigate the influence of the bondcoat deposition process as well as topcoat–bondcoat interface topography. The results showed that the dense PS-PVD-processed TBC had the highest lifetime, although at an expense of the highest thermal conductivity. The reason for this behavior was attributed to the dense intracolumnar structure, wide intercolumnar gaps and high column density, thus improving the strain tolerance and fracture toughness.</jats:p>"

Combustion flames have been captured using the AVL combustion analyzer to analyze the development and propagation of flames within the engine cylinder. From the flame images, it was observed that propagation of flame was faster in MAO coated piston compared to uncoated piston. This is because of higher local temperature inside the combustion chamber that was resulted due to low thermal conductivity of MAO layer.

A newly developed experimental thermal and environmental barrier coating (TEBC) system, consisting of a 170 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m thick CoNiCrAlY bond coat (BC) and a bilayer ceramic top coat (TC), with an interlayer and an upper layer, was deposited using air plasma spray techniques. The ceramic interlayer with an average thickness of 77 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m was formed from agglomerated and sintered yttria-stabilized zirconia. An experimental mixture of mullite (Al<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>Si<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>13</jats:sub>) and hexacelsian (BaAl<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Si<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>8</jats:sub>) at a ratio of 70/30 vol.% was sprayed as the upper layer. The average thickness of the TC was 244 <jats:italic>μ</jats:italic>m. The specimen sections were investigated using a TESCAN Lyra3 XMU scanning electron microscope (SEM) to characterise the microstructure of both the TEBC and the substrate material. The fatigue damage mechanisms in the TEBC-coated superalloy were studied. The fatigue life curves in the representation of the total strain amplitude versus the number of cycles to failure of the TEBC-coated and uncoated superalloy were assessed. TEBC was found to have a slight, positive effect on the fatigue life of MAR-M247.</jats:p>"

34185,"<jats:p>Since the formation of fouling reduces heat transfer efficiency and causes energy loss, anti-fouling is desirable and may be achieved by coating. In this work, a nickel-tungsten-phosphorus (Ni-W-P) coating was prepared on the mild steel (1015) substrate using electroless plating by varying sodium tungstate concentration to improve its anti-fouling property. Surface morphology, microstructure, fouling behavior, and heat transfer performance of coatings were further reported. Also, the reaction path, transition state, and energy gradient change of calcite, aragonite, and vaterite were also calculated. During the deposition process, as the W and P elements were solids dissolved in the Ni crystal cell, the content of Ni element was obviously higher than that of the other two elements. Globular morphology was evenly covered on the surface. Consequently, the thermal conductivity of ternary Ni-W-P coating decreases from 8.48 W/m·K to 8.19 W/m·K with the increase of W content. Additionally, it goes up to 8.93 W/m·K with the increase of heat source temperature 343 K. Oxidation products are always accompanied by deposits of calcite-phase CaCO3 fouling. Due to the low surface energy of Ni-W-P coating, Ca2+ and [CO3]2− are prone to cross the transition state with a low energy barrier of 0.10 eV, resulting in the more formation of aragonite-phase CaCO3 fouling on ternary Ni-W-P coating. Nevertheless, because of the interaction of high surface energy and oxidation products on the bare matrix or Ni-W-P coating with superior W content, free Ca2+ and [CO3]2− can be easy to nucleate into calcite.

The thermal conductivities of the multi-sized thermal barrier coatings after a long-term serving at high temperature were tested through laser flash heating method. Meanwhile, the physical models of thermal barrier coatings with multi-sized porous structure at micro and nano scales were constructed through Ansys Workbench. The evolutions of thermal conductivity of thermal barrier coatings with multi-sized pores after long-term service at 1100 °C were investigated through computation. It was found that the thermal conductivity of the coating increased with the extension of the serving time. When the serving time reached 60 days, the thermal conductivity of the coating tended to be stable and close to the compacted bulk. The computational results were consistent with the tested ones, which could be helpful to explain the thermal conducting evolution in thermal barrier coatings with multi-sized porous structure at nano and micro scales after long-term serving at high temperature.</jats:p>"

34499,"<jats:p>High-porosity thermal barrier coatings are utilized on gas turbine components where maximizing the coating thermal insulation capability is the primary design criteria. Though such coatings have been in industrial use for some time, manufacturing high-porosity coatings quickly and efficiently has proven challenging. With the industry demand to increase productivity and reduce waste generation, there is a drive to look at improved coating manufacturing methods. This article looks at high-porosity coatings manufactured using a high-power plasma system in comparison with a current industrial coating. A commercial spray powder is compared with an experimental Low-Density powder developed to maximize coating porosity without sacrificing coating deposition efficiency. The resultant coatings have been assessed for their microstructure, adhesion strength, furnace cyclic lifetime, thermal conductivity and sintering behavior. Finally, the impact of spray processing on coating economics is discussed. The use of a Low-Density powder with a high-power plasma system allows a high-porosity coating to be manufactured more efficiently and more cost effectively than with conventional powder feedstock. The improvement in thermal properties for the experimental coating demonstrates there is scope to improve industrial coatings by designing with specific thermal resistance rather than thickness and porosity as coating requirements.</jats:p>"

In this study, the hot corrosion behavior of BaNd2Ti3O10 in Na2SO4 + V2O5 molten salt at 900 °C and 1000 °C is investigated. Exposed to the salt for 4 h at 900 °C, BaNd2Ti3O10 pellets had an obvious reaction with the salt, forming corrosion products of NdVO4, TiO2, and BaSO4, and the reaction layer was ~30 μm, beneath which no salt trace could be found. Prolonging the corrosion time to 20 h, the type of the corrosion products had no change. At an elevated corrosion temperature of 1000 °C for 4 h, the corrosion products were still NdVO4, TiO2, and BaSO4, but NdVO4 revealed a significant growth, which fully covered the pellet surface. The mechanisms by which the corrosion reaction between BaNd2Ti3O10 and the molten salt occurred were discussed.</jats:p>"
34501,"<jats:p>In the past decades, the durability of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) has been extensively studied. The majority of researches emphasized the problem of oxidation, corrosion, and erosion induced by foreign object damage (FOD). TBCs with low thermal conductivity are usually coated on the hot-section components of the aircraft engine. The main composition of the TBCs is top-coat, which is usually regarded as a wear-resistant and heat-insulating layer, and it will significantly improve the working temperature of the hot-section components of the aircraft engine. The application of TBCs are serviced under a complex and rigid environment. The external parts of the TBCs are subjected to high-temperature and high-pressure loading, and the inner parts of the TBCs have a large thermal stress due to the different physical properties between the adjacent layers of the TBCs. To improve the heat efficiency of the hot-section components of aircraft engines, the working temperature of the TBCs should be improved further, which will result in the failure mechanism becoming more and more complicated for TBCs; thus, the current study is focusing on reviewing the failure mechanism of the TBCs when they are serviced under the actual high temperature conditions. Finite element simulation is an important method to study the failure mechanism of the TBCs, especially under some extremely rigid environments, which the experimental method cannot realize. In this paper, the research progress of the failure mechanism of TBCs at high temperature via finite element modeling is systematically reviewed.</jats:p>"
34502,"<jats:p>Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are considered a promising solution for improving the efficiency of internal combustion engines. Among the thermal spray processes, the relatively newly developed suspension plasma spray (SPS) is an attractive candidate due to its unique microstructural features that have already demonstrated increased performance in gas turbine applications. To achieve these features, thermal spray conditions play an essential role. In specific uses, such as piston of diesel engines, parameters as spray angle and spray distance pose challenges to keep them constant during the whole spray process due to the complex geometry of the piston. To understand the effect of the spray distance and spray angle, a comprehensive investigation of the produced thermal spray microstructure on the piston geometry was conducted. Flat and complex geometry surfaces were coated using the same plasma parameters while the spray angle and distance were changed. Characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with the image analysis technique to perceive the variation of the thickness and microstructures features such as pores, cracks, column density, and column orientation. The results showed that the changes in spray angles and spray distances due to the complex shape of the substrate have a significant influence on the microstructure and thermal properties (thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity) of the coatings. The thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity were calculated by modeling for the different regions of the piston and measured by laser flash analysis combined with modeling for the flat-surfaced coupon. It was shown that the modeling approach is an effective tool to predict the thermal properties and thus to understand the influence of the parameters on the coating properties. Connecting the observations of the work on the microstructural and thermal properties, the complex geometry’s influence on the produced coatings could be diminished by tailoring the process and generating the most desirable TBC for the internal combustion engines in future applications.</jats:p>"
34503,"<jats:p>The paper examines control and management by thermal mode of the internal surface of heat-insulated combustion chamber walls for green &amp; efficient diesel and gas turbine engines due to the application of opaque or semitransparent thermal barrier materials (coatings). The authors’ model is devoted to combined radiant heat transfer both inside the heat-insulated combustion chamber and its ceramics walls, which could be scattering and absorbing for penetrating radiant component in the subsurface volume of optically heterogeneous porous material. The influence of thermal conduction, scattering (absorption) and external convective effects on the increase of the internal overheating zone in subsurface layers is simulated under intensive radiation. The unique set of optical, thermal-physical and mechanical properties of structural ceramics, depending on their porosity, were first proposed. The radiation fields of the absorbed energy in the near IR region and the corresponding temperature distributions in the modeled opaque and semitransparent ceramics walls were calculated under a stationary radiant-convective heat load during the active combustion phase at time intervals 0.01…0.1 s (diesel engines) and 10...100 s (turbine ones). In order to control the emission of nitrogen oxides, the authors propose a generation model of NOx, its growth or reduction caused by the management of radiant overheating inside semitransparent heat-insulation in which surface temperature is due to volumetric radiant absorption. It is shown that for semitransparent materials (coatings), the optimal thermal mode is determined first of all by thermal radiant characteristics in near IR at heating small times and it begins to correct at long ones due to the effect of thermal conductivity. This process may be modeled and regulated by the selected microstructural porosity of ceramic heat insulation.</jats:p>"

The HiPIMS silver film, sputtered with a peak current of 200 A and an approximately equivalent average power density to the DC magnetron sputtered silver, exhibits higher reflectance (and conductivity). Increasing the power density further, yields silver films with lower reflectance, correlating to a reduced grain size. In the protected silver film system, the reflectance does not improve, due to the presence of a less reflective top adhesion layer. The protected film system, with the 200 A HiPIMS, is, however, more durable at 400 °C than the DC magnetron sputtered equivalent.</jats:p>"
34505,"<jats:p>Thermal conductivity of porous thermal barrier coatings was evaluated using a newly developed five-phase model. It was demonstrated that porosities distributed in coating strongly affect thermal conductivity. The decisive reason for this change in thermal conductivity can be traced back to defect morphology and its orientation, depending on the coating deposition technique and process parameters used during deposition. In this paper, the Bruggeman’s two-phase model was used as a reference, and a five-phase model was developed to evaluate the thermal conductivity of porous coatings. This approach uses microstructural details of the shape, size, orientation and volumetric fraction of defects of coatings as input parameters. The proposed model can predict thermal conductivity values better than the previous two-phase model.</jats:p>"

APS thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) with a similar monoclinic phase were prepared. The pore sizes and distributions of the coatings were obtained by scanning their cross-section via SEM; the scanned areas were over 1 mm × 2 mm and more than 23,000 pores for each coating were analyzed. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the porosity data and then to determine the quantitative relationship between different types of pores and thermal conductivity. Results revealed that the different pores have different effects on decreasing the thermal conductivity. The small, vertical pores have the biggest effect, while the horizontal pores also play a significant role in decreasing the thermal conductivity.</jats:p>"

The phase composition, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties of TiO2-doped ErSZ were investigated. ErSZ had a non-transformable metastable tetragonal (t′) phase, the compound with 5 mol % TiO2 consisted of t′ and cubic (c) phases, while 10 mol % TiO2 doped ErSZ had t′, c, and about 3.5 mol % monoclinic (m) phases. Higher TiO2 doping contents caused more m phase, and the compounds were composed of t′ and m phases. When the dopant content was below 10 mol %, TiO2 doping could decrease the thermal conductivity and enhance the toughness of the compounds. At higher doping levels, the compounds exhibited an increased thermal conductivity and a reduction in the toughness, mainly attribable to the formation of the undesirable m phase. Hence, 10 mol % TiO2-doped ErSZ could be a promising candidate for TBC applications.</jats:p>"

The methodologies developed to measure char expansion of the three coatings during the cone experiment as well under slow heating conditions using an advanced rheometric expansion system have been discussed. While the expansion ratios in the two experiments were different, the trends were similar. Thermal conductivities of the chars as a function of time were measured, which could be related to the intumescence steps of respective coatings. The accurate measurements of these parameters are important in predicting the surface requirements of an ideal coating that can enable a given composite structure to survive a defined thermal threat for a specified period of time.</jats:p>"

Addition of mullite phase into the YSZ coating can improve resulting high temperature properties. The contribution focuses on high temperature cyclic oxidation behaviour of two TBC systems with different top coats (TC) deposited by the means of atmospheric plasma spraying. The initial mullite-YSZ powder mixture consisted of 29 vol. % of mullite and 71 vol. % of YSZ. The conventional TBC system consisted of ~ 150 µm thick NiCoCrAlYHfSi bond coat (BC) and ~ 300 µm thick YSZ top coat.

The experimental TBC proved higher lifetime, durability and phase stability and also lower grow rate of thermally grown oxide (TGO) compared to conventional TBC.

Samples were oxidized at 800°C in the both atmospheres representative of the HTVE operating conditions: Ar-1%H2-9%H2O (for cathode side) and air (for anode side). The high temperature oxidation behaviour was studied in both atmospheres together with the electrical conductivity of the thermally grown oxide scales. Oxidation kinetics indicated lower oxidation rate in H2/H2O compared to air (kp = 3.8 .10-15 g2.cm-4.s-1 in H2/H2O and kp = 1.6 .10-14 g2.cm-4.s-1 in air). The corrosion products were characterized by scanning electron microscopy associated with X-ray diffraction analyses and energy dispersive X-ray analyses. The sample electrical behaviour was evaluated by determining the Area Specific Resistance (ASR). The ASR was higher in H2/H2O (ASR = 1 ohm.cm2) than in air (ASR = 0.04 ohm.cm2). The diffusion of proton or hydrogen containing species through the oxide scale is proposed to be responsible for the increase of the electrical conductivity in cathode side.</jats:p>

Measurements of thermal diffusivity with the laser-flash method were performed within the temperature range of 25°C-1100°C with two and ten hours of annealing. The measurements were performed on the single-layer (AMS 5599 alloy), double-layer (AMS 5599 alloy + NiCrAlY interlayer) and three-layer samples (AMS 5599 alloy + NiCrAlY interlayer + ceramic layer of RE2Zr2O7). By using the NETZSCH Proteus software and the results for the single-layer sample, thermal diffusivity of the interlayer itself was determined by means of the double-layer model. A similar method was used to determine the thermal diffusivity of the ceramic layer. The obtained results showed lower thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity for the new type of coatings in comparison with the standard zirconium concerning TBCs. Those results are slightly different compared with the results obtained for the initial powders, which indicates a crucial role of the ceramic layer microstructure (architecture of cracks and porosity).</jats:p>"

34551,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This work presents computational models of ingot evaporation for electron-beam physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) that can be applied to the deposition and development of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). TBCs are insulating coatings that protect aero-engine components from high temperatures, which can be above the component’s melting point. The development of advanced TBCs is fuelled by the need to improve engine efficiency by increasing the engine operating temperature. Rare-earth zirconates (REZ) have been proposed as the next-generation TBCs due to their low coefficient of thermal conductivity and resistance to molten calcium-magnesium alumina-silicates (CMAS). However, the evaporation of REZ has proven to be challenging, with some coatings displaying compositional segregation across their thickness. The computational models form part of a larger analytical model that spans the whole EB-PVD process. The computational models focus on ingot evaporation, have been implemented in MATLAB and include data from 6 oxides: ZrO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, Y<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, Gd<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, Er<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, La<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> and Yb<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>. Two models (2D and 3D) successfully evaluate the evaporation rates of constituent oxides from multiple-REZ ingots, which can be used to highlight incompatibilities and preferential evaporation of some of these oxides. A third model (local composition activated, LCA) successfully predicts the evaporation rate of the whole ingot and replicates the cyclic change in composition of the evaporated plume, which is manifested as changes in compositional segregation across the coating’s thickness. The models have been validated with experimental data from Cranfield University’s EB-PVD coaters, published vapour pressure calculations and evaporation rate formulas described in the literature.</jats:p>"

                  <jats:bold>In modern aircraft engines,</jats:bold> a high number of complex high-performance components are employed, which are partly subjected to extreme loading. For instance, the high-pressure turbine blades of the first stage after the combustor are both thermally-mechanically loaded and experience severe corrosive attack. Therefore they are furnished with several protective systems in order to improve the fatigue life and reliability of the high-temperature material blades employed. A ceramic thermal barrier coating insulates the internally and film-cooled blades against the hot gas stream whilst the underlying layer (PtAl, Al, MCrAlY) protects the substrate material against corrosive attack and oxidation. Owing to the low electrical conductivity of the materials employed in the multilayered system of the high-pressure turbine blades with layer thicknesses of 20–150 μm, conventional eddy-current and thermographic technologies are only suitable to a limited extent to non-destructively detect the condition of the individual layers separately from the substrate material. In contrast to this, with the aid of multi-parameter, high-frequency eddy-current technologies and high-frequency induction thermography using pulsed excitation, the eddy-currents with test frequencies in the mega-Hertz range (up to 100 MHz) can be limited to the near subsurface and produce standard penetration depths of &lt;50 μm; which enables the layer and substrate materials to be differentially studied. The objective of the present study was to non-destructively detect the condition of the coatings, to characterise and determine the thickness of the coating as well as to detect the condition of the substrate material and sensitively analyse local damage and defects.</jats:p>"

34680,"<jats:p> Although vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) are thermal insulators with very low center-of-panel thermal conductivity, their effective thermal conductivity is raised significantly due to large edge heat fluxes caused by a continuously enveloping high barrier laminate, especially if metal based foils are applied. This study therefore presents and validates two analytical approximating models for calculating this thermal edge effect for thin high barrier laminates around VIPs. A comparison of these models with numerical simulations shows that they can be applied with an inaccuracy of &lt;5% for idealized barrier laminates, considering the limitations specified. These models also demonstrate that the linear thermal transmittance, representing this edge effect, amongst others depends on envelope thickness and thermal conductivity, panel thickness, and center-of-panel thermal conductivity. Moreover, this study shows that these models are able to estimate the linear thermal transmittance resulting from more realistic VIPs with seams near their edges, as well. For these realistic panels, deviations between numerical data and prediction model maximally amount to about 9%. Using the presented models then, enables VIP designers, architects, and building engineers to estimate the overall thermal performance of a VIP. </jats:p>"

34688,"<jats:p> Condensing heat exchangers are thermal devices subjected to extremely corrosive environments due to the formation of acidic condensates on the heat-exchange elements during service. To protect the heat exchangers from chemical attack, perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) coating has been applied as a barrier layer onto the surfaces of the heat-exchange elements to prevent corrosion. However, PFA has intrinsically poor thermal conductivity, and low wear resistance; thus, it is not naturally a good material for heat exchanger application. In this study, graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) are incorporated into PFA powder as coating materials to improve the thermal properties of the fluoropolymer, for condensing heat exchangers application. Two grades of GNPs (8 nm and 60 nm layer thickness) are tested to evaluate the effect of graphene addition on the thermal, adhesion, electrical, and wear properties of the composites, which are compared to those mixed with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The results showed that both grades of GNPs significantly increased the thermal conductivity, i.e., ∼8× that of the virgin PFA. The composites incorporated with both grades of GNPs also demonstrated good coating adhesion strength and wear resistance, as well as excellent corrosion resistance. The composite filled with MWCNTs exhibited poor surface finish and minimal improvement in thermal performance. </jats:p>"
34689,"<jats:p> Current sheet molding compound (SMC) panels, when coated with powder primer, show primer popping in the bake oven due to the degassing of the substrate moisture. In the absence of moisture, however, it was found that some SMCs showed severe popping, while other SMC materials did not. These results suggested that, contrary to general opinion, the moisture content in SMC might not be the only cause for popping. This report covers the results of a systematic study that was carried out to identify the factors that contribute to powder primer popping. Several potential variables that could affect popping, such as volatiles in the substrate, thermal conductivity of the substrate, static charges, and powder bake profile were studied. The experiments showed that the poly(vinyl acetate) in the low profile additive (LPA) is the main cause. More specifically, the micro void formation of this low profile additive that eliminates SMC shrinkage, and enables a smooth surface finish, also causes primer popping. Based on the experimental results, it was concluded that the air permeation into these micro voids is the reason behind the popping of the moisture free SMC substrates. This understanding of the failure mechanism, paves the way for the development of low moisture absorbing SMC materials that can be powder primed in our assembly plants, and could remove the barriers for the usage of SMC on GM vehicles. </jats:p>"

34691,"<jats:p>The improvement of high temperature materials with lower heat transfer coefficients lead to the development of thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). One of the most widely used materials for thermal barrier coatings is Y2O3 stabilized ZrO2 (Y-TZP) because of its excellent shock resistance, low thermal conductivity, and relatively high coefficient of thermal expansion. The aim of this work is to study the TBCs mechanical behavior with the addition of SiC into the suspension of Y-TZP/Al2O3 by acoustic emission (AE). Additionally, a microstructural analysis and a finite elements model were carried out in order to compare results. The coatings were made by suspension plasma spray (SPS) on metal plates of 70 × 12 × 2 mm3. An intermetallic was deposited as a bond coating, followed by a coating of Y-TZP/Al2O3 with and without 15 wt.% SiC, with thicknesses between 87 and 161 μm. The AE becomes a fundamental tool in the study of the mechanical behavior of thermal barriers. The use of wavelet transforms streamlines the study and analysis of recorded sound spectra.

34692,"<jats:p>Graphene has excellent mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. Graphene can serve as potential reinforcement in polymer-based nanocomposites. In order to achieve this goal, graphene has to be distributed homogeneously and dispersed throughout the polymer matrix, establishing a strong interface with the polymer. Solution mixing is an interesting method for the preparation of homogeneous nanocomposites, in particular when using environmentally friendly solvents such as water. The major difficulty met in the production of graphene/polymer composites concerns the preparation and stabilization of graphene in aqueous suspension. In the present work three different graphite-based materials, with different crystallinity and purity grades, were exfoliated in aqueous solution of an amphiphilic pyrene derivative, forming few-layer graphene (FLG). The FLG prepared was dispersed in waterborne polyurethane (WPU) to produce composite films. The composite films were produced by solvent casting and spray coating, forming free-standing films that were characterized in terms of its distribution of FLG through the composite, its permeability to water vapor, its electrical resistivity, and its mechanical properties. The studies demonstrated the influence of different factors on the composite film properties such as the use of graphite vs. FLG, the FLG lateral dimensions, and the FLG composition and composite preparation method.</jats:p>"

However, it has long been a fatal problem that LM would cause serious corrosion and embrittlement on the classical substrate made of aluminum alloys in constructing chip cooling device. Here, anodic oxidation treatment was introduced on processing the aluminum alloy aiming to tackle the corrosion issues. The prepared anodic oxidation aluminum (AAO) coatings were composed of nanopore layers and barrier layers on a high-purity alumina matrix that were manufactured electrochemically. According to the measurement, the effective thermal conductivity of the anodized aluminum alloy increases with the total thickness of sample increasing. When the total thickness L exceeds 5 × 10−3 m, effects of the porous media on effective thermal conductivity are negligible via model simulation and calculation. It was experimentally found that aluminum alloy after surface anodization treatment presented excellent corrosion resistance and outstanding heat transfer performance even when exposed in eutectic gallium–indium (E-GaIn) LM over 200 °C. The convective heat transfer coefficient of LM for anodized sample reached the peak when the heat load is 33.3 W.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a new method, the pulsed thermal imaging–multilayer analysis (PTI–MLA) method, which can measure the coating thermal conductivity and heat capacity distributions over an entire engine component surface. This method utilizes a multilayer heat transfer model to analyze the surface temperature response acquired from a one-sided pulsed thermal imaging experiment. It was identified that several experimental system parameters and TBC material parameters may affect the coating surface temperature response. All of these parameters were evaluated and incorporated as necessary into the formulations. The PTI–MLA method was demonstrated by analyzing three TBC samples, and the experimental results were compared with those obtained from other methods.</jats:p>"
34696,"<jats:p>This paper presents a numerical solution of the hyperbolic heat conduction equation in a thermal barrier coating (TBC) structure under an imposed heat flux on the exterior of the TBC. The non-Fourier heat conduction equation is used to model the heat conduction in the TBC system that predicts the heat flux and the temperature distribution. This study presents a more realistic approach to evaluate in-service performance of thin layers of TBCs typically found in hot sections of land based and aircraft gas turbine engines. In such ultrafast heat conduction systems, the orders of magnitude of the time and space dimensions are extremely short which renders the traditional Fourier conduction law, with its implicit assumption of infinite speed of thermal propagation, inaccurate. There is, therefore, the need for an advanced modeling approach for the thermal transport phenomenon taking place in microscale systems. A hyperbolic heat conduction model can be used to predict accurately the transient temperature distribution of thermal barrier structures of turbine blades. The hyperbolic heat conduction equations are solved numerically using a new numerical scheme codenamed the mean value finite volume method (MVFVM). The numerical method yields minimal numerical dissipation and dispersion errors and captures the discontinuities such as the thermal wave front in the solution with reliable accuracy. Compared with some traditional numerical methods, the MVFVM method provides the ability to model the behavior of the single phase lag thermal wave following its reflection from domain boundary surfaces. In addition, parametric studies of properties of the substrate on the temperature and the heat flux distributions in the TBC revealed that relaxation time of the substrate material, unlike the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity has very little effect on the transient thermal response in the TBC. The study further showed that for thin film structures subject to short time durations of heat flux, the hyperbolic model yields more realistic results than the parabolic model.</jats:p>"
34697,"<jats:p>The cross-plane thermal conductivity of several nanoscale layered oxides SiO2/Y2O3, SiO2/Cr2O3, and SiO2/Al2O3, synthesized by e-beam evaporation was measured in the range from 30 K to 300 K by the 3ω method. Thermal conductivity attains values around 0.5 W/m K at room temperature in multilayer samples, formed by 20 bilayers of 10 nm SiO2/10 nm Y2O3, and as low as 0.16 W/m K for a single bilayer. The reduction in thermal conductivity is related to the high interface density, which produces a strong barrier to heat transfer rather than to the changes of the intrinsic thermal conductivity due to the nanometer thickness of the layers. We show that the influence of the first few interfaces on the overall thermal resistance is higher than the subsequent ones. Annealing the multilayered samples to 1100°C slightly increases the thermal conductivity due to changes in the microstructure. These results suggest a route to obtain suitable thermal barrier coatings for high temperature applications.</jats:p>"
34698,"<jats:p>Essentially all models for prediction of thermal contact conductance or thermal contact resistance have assumed optically flat surfaces for simplification. A few thermal constriction models have been developed which incorporate uncoated, optically non-flat surfaces based on the bulk mechanical properties of the material. Investigations have also been conducted which incorporate the thermophysical properties of metallic coatings and their effective surface microhardness to predict the overall thermal contact conductance. However, these studies and subsequent models have also assumed optically flat surfaces; thus, the application of these models to optically non-flat, coated surface conditions is not feasible without modifications. The present investigation develops a thermomechanical model that combines both microscopic and macroscopic thermal resistances for non-flat, roughened, surfaces with non-metallic coatings. The thermomechanical model developed as a result of this study predicts the thermal contact resistance of several non-metallic coatings deposited on metallic aluminum substrates quite well.</jats:p>"
34699,"<jats:p>The photoacoustic (PA) technique is one of many techniques for measuring thermal conductivity of thin films. Compared with other techniques for thermal conductivity measurement, the photoacoustic method is relatively simple, yet is able to provide accurate thermal conductivity data for many types of thin films and bulk materials. In this work, the PA measurement in a high frequency range is made possible by a newly developed PA apparatus, which extends the limit of the PA technique. Thermal conductivities of SiO2 with thicknesses from 0.05 to 0.5 μm on Si wafer, e-beam evaporated thin nickel film on Si wafer, and thermal barrier coatings are obtained. In addition to the commonly used phase shift fitting, which is only appropriate for thermally-thin films, an amplitude fitting method is developed and employed for measuring both thin films and bulk materials with smooth or rough surfaces. Comparing results by amplitude fitting to those obtained by other methods and reference values shows good agreements. Applications and limitations of the photoacoustic technique are discussed.</jats:p>"

Although absolute values of thermal conductivity were overestimated due to a simple model used in this study, relative values were in good agreement with experiment, which indicates that phonon scattering due to Y2O3 addition is reproduced well. It is found from quantitative analysis of the phonon scattering using the mean field theory that decrease of the thermal conductivity upon Y2O3 addition is attributed not only to the introduction of O2- vacancies but also to substitution of Y3+ ions for Zr4+ ions.</jats:p>"

Then, the mathematical formula of each structural parameter was derived to demonstrate the numerical outcome and predict the effective thermal conductivity. After that, the heat conduction characteristics of the columnar structured coating was analyzed to reveal the dependence of the effective thermal conductivity of the thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on its microstructure characteristics, including the column diameter, the thickness of coating, the ratio of the height of fine column to coarse column and the inclination angle of columns.

The influence of Yb2SiO5 addition on the microstructure, mechanical properties, and thermal conductivity of ytterbium-silicate-mullite composites was investigated. Results show that the composites mainly consisted of a mullite matrix and some in situ formed Yb2Si2O7 and Al2O3 phases. By the addition of Yb2SiO5, the Vickers hardness of composites reached ~9.0 at an additive concentration of 5 mol %. Fracture toughness increased to ~2.7 MPa·m1/2 at the additive concentration of 15 mol %, owing to the trans-granular fracture and crack deflection of the pinning effect of the Al2O3 phase in the composites. With the increase of the Al2O3 phase in the composite, the thermal conductivity for the 15YbAM reached around 4.0 W/(m·K) at 1200 °C.

The thermal conductivity and microstructure were investigated and were compared with YSZ. The recrystallized fraction components of all TBCs were quantified. It is clearly found that the component of “recrystallized” and “deformed” grains for La-YSZ TBCs is much higher than that for YSZ TBCs. This could be due to La3+ doping enlarging the lattice parameter of YSZ and thus increasing the melting index, which in turns leads to the smaller grain size of La-YSZ TBCs. As a result, the thermal conductivities of La-YSZ TBCs were distinctly lower than those of YSZ TBCs.</jats:p>"
34957,"<jats:p>Solid oxide fuel cells need a diffusion barrier layer to protect the zirconia-based electrolyte if a cobalt-containing cathode material like lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF) is used. This protective layer must prevent the direct contact and interdiffusion of both components while still retaining the oxygen ion transport. Gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) meets these requirements. However, for a favorable cell performance, oxide ion conducting films that are thin yet dense are required. Films with a thickness in the sub-micrometer to micrometer range were produced by the dry room temperature spray-coating technique, aerosol deposition. Since commercially available GDC powders are usually optimized for the sintering of screen printed films or pressed bulk samples, their particle morphology is nanocrystalline with a high surface area that is not suitable for aerosol deposition. Therefore, different thermal and mechanical powder pretreatment procedures were investigated and linked to the morphology and integrity of the sprayed films. Only if a suitable pretreatment was conducted, dense and well-adhering GDC films were deposited. Otherwise, low-strength films were formed. The ionic conductivity of the resulting dense films was characterized by impedance spectroscopy between 300 °C and 1000 °C upon heating and cooling. A mild annealing occurred up to 900 °C during first heating that slightly increased the electric conductivity of GDC films formed by aerosol deposition.</jats:p>"
34958,"<jats:p>Using first principle calculations, the effect of Ce with different doping concentrations in the network of Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) is studied. The ZrO2 cell volume linearly increases with the increasing Ce doping concentration. The intrinsic band gap of ZrO2 of 5.70 eV reduces to 4.67 eV with the 2.08% Ce doping. In 4.16% cerium doped ZrO2, the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum come closer to each other, about 1.1 eV, compared to ZrO2. The maximum band gap reduction of ZrO2 is observed at 6.25% Ce doping concentration, having the value of 4.38 eV. No considerable shift in the band structure is found with further increase in the doping level. The photo-response of the ZrO2 is modulated with Ce insertion, and two distinct modifications are observed in the absorption coefficient: an imaginary part of the dielectric function and conductivity. A 2.08% Ce-doped ZrO2 modeled system reduces the intensities of peaks in the optical spectra while keeping the peaks of intrinsic ZrO2. However, the intrinsic peaks related to ZrO2 completely vanish in 4.16%, 6.25%, 8.33%, and 12.5% Ce doped ZrO2, and a new absorption hump is created.</jats:p>"

For larger depths sublayer removal is necessary to gain reliable residual stress data. The established method for sublayer removal is electrochemical etching, which fails, since the spinel layer is inert. However, a mechanical layer removal will affect the local residual stress distribution.As an alternative, mechanical residual stress analyses techniques can be applied.

Hence, an important part in the assessment of ASPS coatings is therefore the characterization of the microstructure and how it is build up, and the determination of porosity.

In this study we have focused the microstructure related to the thickness of TBC and their thermal properties, with specific attention to defect species as well as to its morphology with the thermal exposure time. Resintering of TBC happens during thermal exposure in a high temperature, resulting in the less strain tolerance and the higher thermal conductivity.

The thermal exposure tests were conducted in different dwell time till 800h at 1100 °C. The thermal diffusivity is significantly increased after thermal exposures, depending on the thermal exposure time. Microstructural analysis clearly shows that the variation of thermal diffusivity is ascribed to the coalescence of small cracks and the resintering effect.

The yet unresolved problem is control of microstructure of high LHA content ceramics and adjustment of porosity upon, to arrive at a material exhibiting low thermal conductivity at high temperature combined with structural reliability. Therefore, a functionally graded alumina/lanthanum hexaaluminate (FGLHA) with a gradient in composition was developed. The thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of FGLHA were compared with the one of the monolithic composite ceramics. The alumina-rich composites showed excellent mechanical properties whereas the LHA-rich composites presented lower thermal conductivity.</jats:p>"
35050,"<jats:p>Ceramics-based thermal barrier coatings are used as heat and wear shields of blades of gas turbine. There are strong needs to evaluate thermophysical properties of coatings, such as thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and heat capacity of them. Since coatings are attached on substrates, it is not easy to measure these properties separately. In order to evaluate the thermal diffusivity of coating attached on substrate, we have tried to apply the multi-layer model based on the response function method and established a procedure for the measurement by the laser flash method. We verified the procedure by the measurements from room temperature to about 1000 K for two-layer ceramics sample prepared by the doctor blade tape casting method. The thermally sprayed CoNiCrAlY coating on the SUS304 substrate was also used for verification.  The thermal diffusivity of coating attached on substrate approximately agreed with that of the single-layer coating removed from substrate. In the case of the ceramics sample, the thermal diffusivity of the coating including the interfacial thermal resistance determined within about 20 % uncertainty. We compared the laser flash measurement signals of the samples prepared by the thermal spraying with variant thickness and found the difference among them. It was found that the procedure has enough resolution to detect the heat shield effect caused by the change with about 200 m in thickness. The result shows that the procedure and analysis were practically effective for the thermal diffusivity estimation of coating attached on the substrate without remove from substrate.</jats:p>"

35098,"<jats:p>Monazite is one of the most valuable natural resources for rare earth oxides (REOs) used as dopants with high added value in ceramic materials for extreme environments applications. The complexity of the separation process in individual REOs, due to their similar electronic configuration and physical–chemical properties, is reflected in products with high price and high environmental footprint. During last years, there was an increasing interest for using different mixtures of REOs as dopants for high temperature ceramics, in particular for ZrO2-based thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) used in aeronautics and energy co-generation. The use of mixed REOs may increase the working temperature of the TBCs due to the formation of tetragonal and cubic solid solutions with higher melting temperatures, avoiding grain size coarsening due to interface segregation, enhancing its ionic conductivity and sinterability. The thermal stability of the coatings may be further improved by using rare earth zirconates with perovskite or pyrochlore structures having no phase transitions before melting. Within this research framework, firstly we present a review analysis about results reported in the literature so far about the use of ZrO2 ceramics doped with mixed REOs for high temperature applications. Then, preliminary results about TBCs fabricated by electron beam evaporation starting from mixed REOs simulating the real composition as occurring in monazite source minerals are reported. This novel recipe for ZrO2-based TBCs, if optimized, may lead to better materials with lower costs and lower environmental impact, as a result of the elimination of REOs extraction and separation in individual lanthanides. Preliminary results on the compositional, microstructure, morphological, and thermal properties of the tested materials are reported.</jats:p>"

35115,"<jats:p>This paper is focused on the basic properties of ceramic composite materials used as thermal barrier coatings in the aerospace industry like SiC, ZrC, ZrB2 etc., and summarizes some principal properties for thermal barrier coatings. Although the aerospace industry is mainly based on metallic materials, a more attractive approach is represented by ceramic materials that are often more resistant to corrosion, oxidation and wear having at the same time suitable thermal properties. It is known that the space environment presents extreme conditions that challenge aerospace scientists, but simultaneously, presents opportunities to produce materials that behave almost ideally in this environment. Used even today, metal-matrix composites (MMCs) have been developed since the beginning of the space era due to their high specific stiffness and low thermal expansion coefficient. These types of composites possess properties such as high-temperature resistance and high strength, and those potential benefits led to the use of MMCs for supreme space system requirements in the late 1980s. Electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) is the technology that helps to obtain the composite materials that ultimately have optimal properties for the space environment, and ceramics that broadly meet the requirements for the space industry can be silicon carbide that has been developed as a standard material very quickly, possessing many advantages. One of the most promising ceramics for ultrahigh temperature applications could be zirconium carbide (ZrC) because of its remarkable properties and the competence to form unwilling oxide scales at high temperatures, but at the same time it is known that no material can have all the ideal properties. Another promising material in coating for components used for ultra-high temperature applications as thermal protection systems is zirconium diboride (ZrB2), due to its high melting point, high thermal conductivities, and relatively low density. Some composite ceramic materials like carbon–carbon fiber reinforced SiC, SiC-SiC, ZrC-SiC, ZrB2-SiC, etc., possessing low thermal conductivities have been used as thermal barrier coating (TBC) materials to increase turbine inlet temperatures since the 1960s. With increasing engine efficiency, they can reduce metal surface temperatures and prolong the lifetime of the hot sections of aero-engines and land-based turbines.</jats:p>"

In this work, a unique Co3O4 polyhedral coating on thermal-stable polyimide (PI) separators was developed by a simple one-step low-temperature calcination method utilizing metal-organic framework (MOF) of Co-based zeolitic-imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-Co) precursors. The unique Co3O4 polyhedral structures possess several structural merits including small primary particle size, large pore size, rich grain boundary, and high ionic conductivity, which endow the ability to adequately adsorb dissolved polysulfides. The flexible-rigid lithium-lanthanum-zirconium oxide-poly(ethylene oxide) (LLZO-PEO) coating has been designed on another side of the polyimide non-woven membranes to inhibit the growth of lithium dendrites. As a result, the as-fabricated Co3O4/polyimide/LLZO-PEO (Co3O4/PI/LLZO) composite separators displayed fair dimensional stability, good mechanical strength, flame retardant properties, and excellent ionic conductivity. More encouragingly, the separator coating of Co3O4 polyhedrons endows Li–S cells with unprecedented high temperature properties (tested at 80 °C), including rate performance 620 mAh g−1 at 4.0 C and cycling stability of 800 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles—much better than the state-of-the-art results.

35117,"<jats:p>Filling epoxy resin (EP) with boron nitride (BN) nanosheets (BNNSs) can effectively improve the thermal conductivity of BN/EP nanocomposites. However, due to the few hydroxyl groups on the surface of BNNSs, silane coupling agent (SCA) cannot effectively modify BNNSs. The agglomeration of BNNSs is severe, which significantly reduces the AC breakdown strength of the composites. Therefore, this paper uses atmospheric pressure bipolar nanosecond pulse dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) Ar+H2O low temperature plasma to hydroxylate BNNSs to improve the AC breakdown strength and thermal conductivity of the composites. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that the hydroxyl content of the BNNSs surface increases nearly two fold after plasma modification. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) show that plasma modification enhances the dehydration condensation reaction of BNNSs with SCA, and the coating amount of SCA on the BNNSs surface increases by 45%. The breakdown test shows that the AC breakdown strength of the composites after plasma modification is improved under different filling contents. With the filling content of BNNSs increasing from 10% to 20%, the composites can maintain a certain insulation strength. Meanwhile, the thermal conductivity of the composites increases by 67% as the filling content increases from 10% (SCA treated) to 20% (plasma and SCA treated). Therefore, the plasma hydroxylation modification method used in this paper can provide a basis for the preparation of high thermal conductivity insulating materials.</jats:p>"

Changing in the TBCs architecture and the application of multilayer coatings, consisting of layers with engineered properties based on the requirements, is a solution to achieve a combination of desired properties. In all of these development methods it is to be understood that the principle is reducing the possibility of formation of cracks, but, once formed, all such cracks can grow under and thermal cycles and eventually lead to coating delamination and spallation.

35514,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloys possess unique dimensional stability, high thermal and electrical conductivities. Their practical application under heat and stress is however limited by their inherent brittleness because ZTE and plasticity are generally exclusive in a single-phase material. Besides, the performance of ZTE alloys is highly sensitive to change of compositions, so conventional synthesis methods such as alloying or the design of multiphase to improve its thermal and mechanical properties are usually inapplicable. In this study, by adopting a one-step eutectic reaction method, we overcome this challenge. A natural dual-phase composite with ZTE and plasticity was synthesized by melting 4 atom% holmium with pure iron. The dual-phase alloy shows moderate plasticity and strength, axial zero thermal expansion, and stable thermal cycling performance as well as low cost. By using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, in-situ neutron diffraction and microscopy, the critical mechanism of dual-phase synergy on both thermal expansion regulation and mechanical property enhancement is revealed. These results demonstrate that eutectic reaction is likely to be a universal and effective method for the design of high-performance intermetallic-compound-based ZTE alloys.</jats:p>"

The system contains regions of almost pure Fe and Ni, separated by areas with variable concentration of components, formed in consequence of the interdiffusion in the electroconsolidation process. The interdiffusion coefficient of the Fe–Ni system has been revealed to be significantly higher than that of an alloy of a similar composition at the same temperature, which is likely the result of the employed SPS technology and the enhanced diffusion along the grain boundaries. The concentration dependence of the interdiffusion coefficient passes through a maximum at a Ni concentration of [Formula: see text]70 at.%. The electrical and thermal conductivity of the studied system is significantly higher than that of an alloy of the same composition. The temperature dependence of the resistivity of the sample in the range 5–300 K is due to the scattering of electrons by defects and phonons, and the scattering of electrons by phonons fits well to the Bloch–Grüneisen–Wilson relation.

The effect of nanoparticle concentrations (0.01 wt.%, 0.1 wt.%, and 1 wt.%) on the nanofluid dispersion, stability, and thermal absorption characteristics was investigated, and a comparative analysis was performed for each type of nanofluid. All types of nanofluids increased the absorbance and electrical conductivity with increasing nanoparticle concentration, which contributed to improving the thermal absorption performance of nanofluids. The results showed that the thermal absorption performance was high in the order of carbon-based nanofluids (CNTs), metal-based nanofluids (Cu), and oxide-based nanofluids (Al2O3). In CNTs nanofluids, the thermal absorption performance expressed the time reduction rate, which was 12.8%, 16.3%, and 16.4% at 0.01 wt.%, 0.1 wt.%, and 1 wt.% test cases, respectively. Therefore, the 0.1 wt.%-CNTs nanofluid is more economical and appropriate. However, in Al2O3 nanofluids, the time reduction rate of the 1 wt.% nanofluid was significantly higher than that of the 0.01 wt.% and 0.1 wt.% nanofluids.

35610,"<jats:p>The thermal performance of closed-cell foams as an insulation device depends on the thermal conductivity. In these systems, the heat transfer mode associated with the convective contribution is generally ignored, and studies are based on the thermo-physical properties that emerge from the conductive contribution, while others include a term for radiative transport. The criterion found in the literature for disregarding convective heat flux is the cell diameter; however, the cell size for which convection is effectively suppressed has not been clearly disclosed, and it is variously quoted in the range 3–10 mm. In practice, changes in thermal conductivity are also attributed to the convection heat transfer mode; hence, natural convection in porous materials is worthy of research. This work extends the field of study of conjugate heat transfer (convection and conduction) in cellular materials using microstructure-based finite element analysis. For air-based insulating materials, the criteria to consider natural convection (Ra=103) is met by cavities with sizes of 9.06 mm; however, convection is developed into several cavities despite their sizes being lower than 9.06 mm, hence, the average pore size that can effectively suppress the convective heat transfer is 6.0 mm. The amount of heat transported by convection is about 20% of the heat transported by conduction within the foam in a Ra=103, which, in turn, produces an increasing average of the conductivity of about 4.5%, with respect to a constant value.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>A shaped charge for wellbore perforation includes a solid metal or powder liner pressed onto a case, sandwiching high explosives which may have varying thermal stability, dictated by the expected time of exposure and bottom hole temperature (BHT). It is common knowledge that post detonation, the liner-jet punctures the gun body and casing, continuing forward to perforate the formation until its eventual collapse. The jet debris is deposited on the crushed zone forming an impermeable skin and a slug at the end of the perforation-tunnel. This reduces fracture conductivity, and thus, production. Here we present a game changing innovation, the development of a shaped charge with a novel responsive liner. The jet created from our novel degradable liner, post detonation punctures the casing and progress to penetrate the formation until an eventual collapse. However, this system is designed so that, during detonation, a water disintegrable reaction product, bulk metallic glasses (BMG) and/or high entropy alloys (HEA), are formed. These degradable BMG/HEA or complexions decorate the grain boundaries and domain interfaces of the impermeable skin lining the crushed zone of the perforation tunnel as amorphous intergranular films (AIFs) and plug at end of the pathway. Interacting with flowback fluids the BMG/HEA promotes grain dropping, disintegrating the liner and carrot leaving behind a clean perforation tunnel, improving fracture conductivity thus enhanced productivity. In addition, a clear perf tunnel has zero skin value. As such, compared to a coated tunnel with gun and charge debris, it needs little or no acid to clean-up. This results in a demarked reduction of formation breakdown pressures with improved economics for the client. Last but not least this leads to cost reduction of authorized field expenditure (AFE) to support optimized performance of completion design allowing for increased production. CLEAR shaped charges have been qualified to customer specifications in field conditions and are ready to be commercialized. An extension of this technology is being applied to design charges for ""Big-Hole"" perforations, for the Plug and Abandonment (P&amp;A) market where an effective cement squeeze, anchoring a plug effectively seals the wellbore, preventing the leakage of residual hydrocarbon and associated contamination and emissions.</jats:p>"

35699,"<jats:p> Incoloy 800H is an austenitic Fe-Ni-Cr based superalloy and used in many applications due to their high corrosion resistance and creep-strength. However, this alloy is difficult to machine or cut material because of their eminent characteristics such as rapid-work hardening, lesser thermal conductivity and easy to tool-material attraction. Hence, the necessary experimental investigation is required to study and optimize the turning parameters of this alloy. This work presents the investigation of turning parameter effects on the Incoloy 800H superalloy with cryogenically treated cutting tool. The dry turning experiments were conducted based on Taguchi L<jats:sub>9</jats:sub> Orthogonal array (OA) with the input parameters of cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The outputs such as material removal rate, surface roughness, cutting force and tool-tip temperature were considered as the responses. The measured output responses were optimized and modeled using Taguchi-based Grey relational analysis (GRA) and response surface methodology (RSM), respectively. The tool flank wear and tool life were examined on coated insert with cryogenically treated, coated insert (without cryogenic treatment) and uncoated insert for comparison. The results revealed that greater amount of tool-wear reduction was observed in the case of coated tool with-cryogenically treated about 47.88%, coated tool without-cryogenically treated about 27.51% when compared with an uncoated tool. Besides, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to find the most significant parameter over the obtained responses. The obtained mathematical model through RSM was agreed with the experimental result. Further, the machined surface topography was examined using White Light Interferometer (WLI). </jats:p>"
35700,"<jats:p>Thermal-sprayed coatings are widely used in various oil and gas industries for wear and corrosion applications. However, increasing performance and requirements make conventional coatings inadequate for future needs. Furthermore, the heat conductivity of bulk materials cannot be minimized easily. Therefore, the use of low porous coating with nanocomposite doping is an effective way to produce coatings with reduced thermal conductivity. Plasma-sprayed Al2O3-TiO2 coatings are found in a wide range of applications recently in many industries because of their exceptional properties including low expenses and ease of availability. In this work, the wear-resistant and low porous coatings of Al2O3 + 3 wt%TiO2 and respective carbon nanotube (CNT) doped coatings are prepared and characterized. The coatings are deposited on the AISI 1020 steel substrate using air plasma spraying. The impact of CNTs reinforcement on the percentage of pores and wear performance of coatings is investigated. Also, wear tracks morphology is investigated to determine the wear mechanism that is responsible for the wear of coatings. From the analysis, it is observed that the formation of cracks as well as micropores is decreased by the addition of carbon nanotubes. Moreover, uniform CNT distribution and good adhesion of coatings with the substrate are the major factors that improve the wear performance of the coated surface.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>Ultra high temperature ceramic (UHTC) materials have attracted attention for hypersonic applications. Currently there is significant interest in possible gas turbine engine applications of UHTC composites as well. However, many of these materials, such as hafnium carbide, zirconium carbide, and zirconium diboride, have significant oxidation resistance and toughness limitations. In addition, these materials are very difficult to manufacture because of their high melting points. In many cases, SiC powder is incorporated into UHTCs to aid in processing and to enhance fracture toughness. This can also improve the materials’ oxidation resistance at moderately high temperatures due to a crack-healing borosilicate phase. ZrB2-SiC composites show very good oxidation resistance up to 1700 °C, due to the formation of SiO2 and ZrO2 scales in numerous prior studies. While this may limit its application to hypersonic applications (due to reduced thermal conductivity and oxidation resistance at higher temperatures), these UHTC-SiC composites may find applications in turbomachinery, as either stand-alone parts or as a component in a multi-layer system.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>The US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), and the University of California – San Diego (UCSD) are developing tough UHTC composites with high durability and oxidation resistance. For this paper, UHTC-SiC composites and high-entropy fluorite oxides were developed using planetary and high-energy ball milling and consolidated using spark plasma sintering. These materials were evaluated for their oxidation-resistance, ablation-resistance, and thermal cycling behavior under a DoD/OSD-funded Laboratory University Collaborative Initiative (LUCI) Fellowship and DoD Vannevar Bush Fellowship Program. In the present paper experimental results and post-test material characterization of SPS sintered ZrB2, ZrB2+SiC, ZrB2+SiC+HfC, HfC+SiC, and HfC+ZrB2 pellets subjected to ablation test are presented.</jats:p>"

35720,"<jats:p> During cold start of internal combustion engines, coolant temperature, and thermal conductivity are key parameters in the heat transfer processes that ultimately affect pollutant emissions and engine performance. Hereupon the use of coolants with suspended nanoparticles, to enhance thermal conductivity, emerged as a promising technology. However, for Newtonian materials, viscosity also increases with nanoparticle concentration. To overcome increased pumping power, the use of non-Newtonian nanofluids makes such application potentially feasible, specifically for shear-thinning materials, in which a higher shear rate leads to reducing shear viscosity due to higher shear stress. Accordingly, a nanofluid, suitable for engine cooling (0.2 wt.% MWCNT-engine coolant/distilled water 30/70 v/v%), was here fabricated and mapped. Shear rate and temperature were varied, with focus on cold start investigation. Shear thinning and shear thickening regions were mapped according to the shear rate levels, for each temperature considered. The nanofluid behaved as shear-thinning material for the entire range of temperatures (−10°C–25°C). Above shear rates of 500 s<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and flow curves with temperatures below −5°C, a prominent shear thickening behavior was observed. Additionally, the relative apparent viscosity data were compared with four classical models. Regarding the curve fitting parameters of a modified Herschel-Bulkley equation, above 0°C, the apparent yield stress, [Formula: see text], was invariant with temperature. Besides, for the temperature range from 0°C to 20°C, the flow index remained approximately constant. For temperatures above −5°C, infinite-shear-rate viscosity and consistency index presented a linear decrease and a third-degree polynomial-like behavior, respectively. </jats:p>"

35724,"<jats:p>The expanded compositional freedom afforded by high-entropy alloys (HEAs) represents a unique opportunity for the design of alloys for advanced nuclear applications, in particular for applications where current engineering alloys fall short. This review assesses the work done to date in the field of HEAs for nuclear applications, provides critical insight into the conclusions drawn, and highlights possibilities and challenges for future study. It is found that our understanding of the irradiation responses of HEAs remains in its infancy, and much work is needed in order for our knowledge of any single HEA system to match our understanding of conventional alloys such as austenitic steels. A number of studies have suggested that HEAs possess ‘special’ irradiation damage resistance, although some of the proposed mechanisms, such as those based on sluggish diffusion and lattice distortion, remain somewhat unconvincing (certainly in terms of being universally applicable to all HEAs). Nevertheless, there may be some mechanisms and effects that are uniquely different in HEAs when compared to more conventional alloys, such as the effect that their poor thermal conductivities have on the displacement cascade. Furthermore, the opportunity to tune the compositions of HEAs over a large range to optimise particular irradiation responses could be very powerful, even if the design process remains challenging.</jats:p>"

Абсолютным стационарным методом продольного теплового потока в интервале 50–300 K исследована теплопроводность природных минералов галенита (PbS), халькопирита (CuFeS2), а также керамики ZnS.Образцы были однородными, имели малое содержание примесей (химический состав образцов контролировался ренгенофлюоресцентным методом) и характеризовались высокими значениями удельного электрического сопротивления (r &gt; 9·10–2 Ом·м при комнатной температуре). Это соответствует электронной составляющей теплопроводности ke &lt; 1·10–4 Вт/(м·К). Результаты измерений теплопроводности представлены графически и в табулированном виде. Все зависимости являются убывающими. Величины теплопроводности (Вт/(м·К)) при 50 К составляют 10.9 для PbS, 62 для CuFeS2 и 73–98 для ZnS. При 300 К соответствующие величины равны 2.48, 10.5 и 18.6–18.8 Вт/(м·К).Все исследованные материалы значительно хуже проводят тепло, чем пирит FeS2. Проведено сравнение полученных данных с литературными. Температурная зависимость теплопроводности галенита является слабой, его низкая теплопроводность благоприятна для термоэлектрических приложений. Выявленная в настоящей работе теплопроводность халькопирита оказалась наивысшей из соответствующих литературных данных. Высокая теплопроводность сульфида цинка коррелирует с ее широкой вариабельностью в зависимости от структурных особенностей материала. Рассчитаны температурные зависимости средней длины свободного пробега фононов. Оцененные для температуры плавления значения этой характеристики для PbS и особенно для ZnS значительно превосходят размеры элементарной кристаллической ячейки, что необычно.&#x0D;

In this work, both hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects around the shock wave are investigated using a discrete Boltzmann model. Via Chapman–Enskog analysis, the local equilibrium and nonequilibrium velocity distribution functions in one-, two-, and three-dimensional velocity space are recovered across the shock wave. Besides, the absolute and relative deviation degrees are defined in order to describe the departure of the fluid system from the equilibrium state. The local and global nonequilibrium effects, nonorganized energy, and nonorganized energy flux are also investigated. Moreover, the impacts of the relaxation frequency, Mach number, thermal conductivity, viscosity, and the specific heat ratio on the nonequilibrium behaviours around shock waves are studied. This work is helpful for a deeper understanding of the fine structures of shock wave and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>One of the challenges in the design and development of a latent heat storage unit (LHSU) is to increase the charging and discharging rates which are inherently low because of low thermal conductivity of phase change materials (PCM). Out of various heat transfer enhancement techniques, employing annular fins is very simple, efficient and no fabrication complexity is involved. Fin parameters (fin size and number of fins) significantly influence the enhancement in heat transfer rate. Hence, optimization of fin parameters is necessary for the efficient design of an LHSU. While designing an LHSU along with heat transfer rate, entropy generation should also be considered in order to make it exergetically efficient. Therefore, the present study is aimed at multi-objective optimization of annular fin parameters to minimize the melting time and entropy generation. Fin diameter and the number of fins are taken as the variables. The influence of these two variables on the melting time, average Nusselt number, energy stored, and distribution of entropy is presented. The melting rate is increased, and global entropy generation decreased by increasing the number of fins up to 15. An increase in the fin diameter reduced the melting time while entropy generation got increased. For the multi-objective optimization, the multi-objective optimization based on ratio analysis (MOORA) technique is chosen and the optimized values of fin diameter and number of fins are observed to be 80 mm and 15 respectively. Finally, optimized parameters are represented in non-dimensional form to make them applicable for any size of the LHSU.</jats:p>"

35781,"<jats:p>The laser-based powder bed fusion (LBPF) process or commonly known as selective laser melting (SLM) has made significant progress since its inception. Initially, conventional materials like 316L, Ti6Al4V, and IN-718 were fabricated using the SLM process. However, it was inevitable to explore the possible fabrication of the second most popular structural material after Fe-based alloys/steel, the Al-based alloys by SLM. Al-based alloys exhibit some inherent difficulties due to the following factors: the presence of surface oxide layer, solidification cracking during melt cooling, high reflectivity from the surface, high thermal conductivity of the metal, poor flowability of the powder, low melting temperature, etc. Researchers have overcome these difficulties to successfully fabricate the different Al-based alloys by SLM. However, there exists no review dealing with the fabrication of different Al-based alloys by SLM, their fabrication issues, microstructure, and their correlation with properties in detail. Hence, the present review attempts to introduce the SLM process followed by a detailed discussion about the processing parameters that form the core of the alloy development process. This is followed by the current research status on the processing of Al-based alloys and microstructure evaluation (including defects, internal stresses, etc.), which are dealt with on the basis of individual Al-based series. The mechanical properties of these alloys are discussed in detail followed by the other important properties like tribological properties, fatigue properties, etc. Lastly, an outlook is given at the end of this review.</jats:p>"

The 3D structures produced using this technique can be modified and adjusted in order to improve the heat transfer parameters (heat conductivity, specific heat transfer area). For this study, complex metal alloy pin-fin structures were immersed in paraffin, and an experimental test stand was built in order to examine the heat transfer characteristics of composite PCMs with pin-fin metal structures. Multiple heating/cooling cycles confirmed the enhanced transfer of heat inside the heat storage unit and allowed us to ascertain the decreased temperature gradient within the heat accumulator.

The introduction of solid phases of non-autoclaved foam concrete with the average density D150 with high values of the standard entropy of formation in it is scientifically substantiated from the point of view of increasing the thermal protection properties. It is shown that such phases have an advantage in comparison with the solid phases of the glass and ceramic microspheres used now. It is also proved that the presence of thin-layer thermal insulation coating of nanoscale particles in the form of silica in the composition favours the reflection of the incident heat flux due to the Tindal effect and provides an increase in the polydispersity of the composition.

36034,"<jats:p>Experimental investigations of nano-scale spatio-temporal effects that occur on the friction surface under extreme tribological stimuli, in combination with thermodynamic modeling of the self-organization process, are presented in this paper. The study was performed on adaptive PVD (physical vapor deposited) coatings represented by the TiAlCrSiYN/TiAlCrN nano-multilayer PVD coating. A detailed analysis of the worn surface was conducted using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) methods. It was demonstrated that the coating studied exhibits a very fast adaptive response to the extreme external stimuli through the formation of an increased amount of protective surface tribo-films at the very beginning of the running-in stage of wear. Analysis performed on the friction surface indicates that all of the tribo-film formation processes occur in the nanoscopic scale. The tribo-films form as thermal barrier tribo-ceramics with a complex composition and very low thermal conductivity under high operating temperatures, thus demonstrating reduced friction which results in low cutting forces and wear values. This process presents an opportunity for the surface layer to attain a strong non-equilibrium state. This leads to the stabilization of the exchanging interactions between the tool and environment at a low wear level. This effect is the consequence of the synergistic behavior of complex matter represented by the dynamically formed nano-scale tribo-film layer.</jats:p>"

36049,"<jats:p>Heat transfer fluids are a crucial parameter that affects the size and costs of heat exchangers. However, the available coolants like water and oils have low thermal conductivities, which put many limitations to the development of heat transfer to achieve high performance cooling. The need for development of new classes of fluids which enhance the heat transfer capabilities attracted the attention of many researchers. In the last few decades, modern nanotechnology developed nanoparticles, which have unique thermal and electrical properties that could help improve heat transfer using nanofluids. A “nanofluid” is a fluid with suspended fine nanoparticles which increases the heat transfer properties compared with the original fluid. Nanofluids are considered a new generation of heat transfer fluids and are considered two-phase fluids of liquid solid mixtures. The efficiency of the fluid could be improved by enhancing its thermal properties, especially the thermal conductivity, and it is expected that the nanofluids will have a greater thermal conductivity than the base fluids. This paper reviews the preparation of metallic and nonmetallic nanofluids along with the stability of the produced nanofluids. Physical and thermal properties as well as a range of applications are also discussed in detail.</jats:p>"

Such an estimate sets an upper bound on κ<jats:sub>e</jats:sub> and is about 30% of the total heat transfer at room temperature.

However, integrating conductivity and neurotrophins into a scaffold that recreates the electrophysiologic and nutritional microenvironment of the spinal cord (SC) remains challenging. In this study we investigated the therapeutic potential of a soft thermo-sensitive polymer electroactive hydrogel (TPEH) loaded with nerve growth factor (NGF) combined with functional electrical stimulation (ES) for the treatment of SCI. The developed hydrogel exhibits outstanding electrical conductance upon ES, with continuous release of NGF for at least 24 days.

The effects of MHD, thermophoresis, nonlinear heat radiation and varying heat conductivity are modeled into the heat equation in the established model. Suitable similarity transformations are examined to bring down the partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations. The Homotopy analysis approach is used to solve the dimensionless transport equations analytically. The graphic information of the various parameters that emerged from the model is effectively collected and deliberated. The temperature field expands with thermophoresis, Brownian motion and temperature ratio parameters as the modified Hartmann number forces an increase in velocity, according to the findings of this analysis. With the increase in the fluid material terms, the entropy generation and Bejan number increase. Riga plate has numerous applications in improving the thermo-physics features of a fluid, the value of magnetic field embraces an important role in fluid mechanics. An external electric field can be used to control flow in weak electrically conductive fluids. The Riga plate is one of the devices used in this regard. It’s a device that creates electromagnetic fields. They produce the Lorentz force which is a force that directs fluid flow. The authors have discussed the entropy optimization for a reactive Williamson nanofluid flow past a vertical Riga plate is addressed. This is the first investigation on mass and heat transfer flow that the authors are aware of, and no similar work has yet been published in the literature. A thorough mathematical examination is also required to demonstrate the model’s regularity.

36463,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The electron emission by micro-protrusions has been studied for over a century, but the complete explanation of the unstable behaviors and their origin remains an open issue. These systems often evolve towards vacuum breakdown, which makes experimental studies of instabilities very difficult. Modeling studies are therefore necessary. In our model, refractory metals have shown the most striking results for discontinuities or jumps recorded on the electron emitted current under high applied voltages. Herein, we provide evidence on the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of a thermal instability during the field emission from refractory metal micro-protrusions. A jump in the emission current at steady state is found beyond a threshold electric field, and it is correlated to a similar jump in temperature. These jumps are related to a transient runaway of the resistive heating that occurs after the Nottingham flux inversion. That causes the hottest region to move beneath the apex, and generates an emerging heat reflux towards the emitting surface. Two additional conditions are required to initiate the runaway. The emitter geometry must ensure a large emission area and the thermal conductivity must be high enough at high temperatures so that the heat reflux can significantly compete with the heat diffusion towards the thermostat. The whole phenomenon, that we propose to call the <jats:italic>Nottingham Inversion Instability</jats:italic>, can explain unexpected thermal failures and breakdowns observed with field emitters.</jats:p>"

We have constructed a first-principles-based machine-learning interatomic potential, which successfully captures the dynamical ferroelectric phase transition of GeTe by adopting the neural network technique. Although the low-energy acoustic phonons remain relatively unaffected at elevated temperatures, the high-energy optical, and longitudinal acoustic phonons demonstrate strong renormalizations as evidenced from the vibrational phonon spectra, which are attributed to the large anharmonicity accompanying the phase transition.

               <jats:p>When analyzing and optimizing the performance of thermoelectric (TE) devices in theory, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and electrical resistivity are indispensable TE properties. However, most manufacturers do not provide or overestimate these data. Under the consideration of temperature dependence, this paper discloses an experimental measurement approach to estimate the equivalent Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and electrical resistivity of a TE module. A thermal resistance network is also established to work out the hot and cold side temperatures of TE legs. Based on a designed test bench, required temperature and electrical parameters in both open circuit and closed circuit are measured and recorded, where the data of open circuit are used to calculate the equivalent Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity, and the data of closed circuit are used to calculate the equivalent electrical resistivity. To eliminate the error of parasitic internal resistance, a thermal-electric finite element model is adopted to modify the equivalent electrical resistivity. The modification results indicate that the equivalent internal resistance is about 1.033 times the real internal resistance, and the ratio is related to the working temperature. This work provides a new idea to obtain the TE material properties via an experimental test.</jats:p>"

These materials provide higher degrees of freedom to design new compounds and adopt new approaches to enhance the electronic transport properties of thermoelectric materials.

However, since PEDOT:Tos is mainly reported to be a p-type thermoelectric material, the development of PSS-free PEDOT with n-type thermoelectric properties is desirable. Thus, in order to search for PSS-free PEDOT with n-type thermoelectric properties, we investigated the doping concentration of PTSA dependence of the thermoelectric property using the first-principle calculation. The band structure and the density of state indicated that the n-type thermal electromotive force was attributed to the electrons’ large effective mass. Such electrons were produced thanks to the binding of the dopant PTSA to the benzene ring. The contribution of the electron to the Seebeck coefficient increased with increasing PTSA doping concentrations.</jats:p>"

36582,"<jats:p>Thermoelectric generators are devices that harvest waste heat and convert it into useful power. They are considered as an additional power source in the domestic sector, but they can also be installed in off-grid objects. In addition, they are a promising solution for regions where there is a lack of electricity. Since biomass heating and cooking stoves are widely used, it is very appropriate to integrate thermoelectric generators with wood-fired stoves. This paper shows the experimental analysis of a micro-cogeneration system equipped with a wood-fired stove and two prototypical constructions of thermoelectric generators dedicated to mounting on the flue gas channel. The first version was equipped with one basic thermoelectric module and used to test various cooling methods, while the second construction integrated four basic thermoelectric modules and a water-cooling system. During the tests conducted, the electricity generated in the thermoelectric generators was measured by the electronic load, which allowed the simulation of various operating conditions. The results obtained confirm the possibility of using thermoelectric generators to generate power from waste heat resulting from the wood-fired stove. The maximum power obtained during the discussed combustion process was 15.4 W (if this value occurred during the entire main phase, the energy generated would be at a level of approximately 30 Wh), while the heat transferred to the water was ca. 750 Wh. Furthermore, two specially introduced factors (CPC and CPTC) allowed the comparison of developed generators, and the conclusion was drawn that both developed constructions were characterized by higher CPC values compared to available units in the market. By introducing thermoelectric modules characterized by higher performance, a higher amount of electricity generated may be provided, and sufficient levels of current and voltage may be achieved.</jats:p>"

These rubbers constitute the insulation and jacket layers of the ESP cables. EPDM rubbers from four different cables operating during different time intervals (2 and 4.8 years) at different depths (from 760 to 2170 m) below sea level were studied. To verify the effects of the long exposure on the rubber performance, thermal analysis was performed to determine the thermal stability and activation energy of degradation. In addition, structural analysis, through vibrational spectroscopy and crosslinking fraction assessment, was carried out. The mechanical properties of the aged rubbers were inferred through the measurement of hardness, while the absorption of a service fluid was studied by gravimetry. The results showed only minor changes in the thermal, structural, mechanical and barrier properties of the EPDM-based ESP cable layers. It is suggested that the thermo-oxidation mechanism followed by chain scission does not have a role in the degradation of EPDM within the aged ESP cables, and no sign of variation of crosslink fractions has been encountered. Therefore, it was concluded that EPDM-based layers seem not to be weak links in the configuration of modern ESP systems.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>To improve the reliability and efficiency of power electronics, their thermal management must be further enhanced. Next-generation electronics systems are predicted to dissipate more heat as die size shrinks and power levels increase. Traditional air-cooling approaches usually provide insufficient performance or require heavy and bulky heat sinks to achieve adequate thermal management. To address this problem, a novel air cooled vertically enhanced manifold microchannel system (VEMMS) was developed. While minimizing the footprint required on the printed circuit board, the system offers efficient thermal management in a conformal scheme that accommodates the associated power electronics and their electrical connections. This work describes the manufacturing process of the air-cooled VEMMS heat sink and its experimental characterization and thermo-fluidic performance. Good agreement was obtained between the test results and numerical predictions. Using air at ambient conditions, thermal resistance of 2.6 K/W was achieved with a single-sided cooling architecture with a &amp;lt;1.5 cm2 footprint and &amp;lt;2 cm3 total heat sink volume. A full-bridge electrical power density of ∼84 kWe/L and overall direct current (DC–DC) converter power density of ∼20 kWe/L were achieved at reasonable flow rates and pressure drops using commercially available miniature electric fans.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) are widely used in many industries. The voltage and output power of TEG chips are critical indicators to evaluate the performance of TEGs. The conventional method is to directly test the output voltage and power of the whole TEG chip that contains 127 pairs of P- and N-type (PN) legs (127-PN-TEG). However, the assembling of these PN legs is very time-consuming. In order to reduce experimental time and the consumption of TEG materials, we proposed an experimental method. We developed the test apparatus for the rapid evaluation of TEG performance using a TEG chip with a single pair of PN legs (1-PN-TEG). We made several 1-PN-TEGs and 127-PN-TEGs using the same thermoelectric material (bismuth telluride). We then measured the voltage and the power of these 1-PN-TEGs and 127-PN-TEGs, respectively. The experimental results were compared and analyzed. The comparison showed that the voltage of 127-PN-TEG is equal to the voltage of 1-PN-TEG times 127, which implies that we could use the test data of 1-PN-TEG to evaluate the performance of 127-PN-TEG. Using the experimental device developed in this paper, we also studied the effects of the PN leg area (cross-sectional area of PN legs) and the pressure applied over the TEGs on the output power of 1-PN-TEG. The experimental results showed that the power per unit area decreases with an increase in the 1-PN-TEG's PN leg area when the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides was constant. Under specific temperature difference conditions, the open-circuit voltage and the output power will increase with the pressure applied on the TEG chips.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>The present article reports on the design, modeling and parametric optimization of a thermoelectric cooling system for electronics applications. An analytical model based on energy equilibrium is developed for cooling a microprocessor using a thermoelectric module with an air-cooled finned heat sink. The proposed analytical model is validated by experimental measurements and by comparison with detailed 3D numerical simulations. Estimation of effective material properties of the thermoelectric module using manufacturer-reported performance characteristics is found to reduce the uncertainty in the calculation of module input power as compared to experimental measurements. A parametric optimization of the thermoelectric module and heat sink is carried out to maximize the coefficient of performance (COP) and achieve the required cooling capacity of the microprocessor. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated for cooling current high power microprocessors. At a constant input current, the cooling capacity and COP of the thermoelectric cooling system increase with increasing thermoelectric module geometric ratio. Furthermore, at a constant geometric ratio, the cooling power increases with increasing input current to reach a maximum value and then decreases. The present study highlights the importance of designing and fabricating high-performance thermoelectric cooler modules with optimum parameters for cooling specific electronic components. The results indicate that the cooling capacity can be increased by ~70% using thermoelectric modules with optimized parameters as compared to using non-optimized commercially available thermoelectric modules.</jats:p>"

36698,"<jats:p>Thermoelectric materials enable the direct conversion between heat and electricity. SnTe is a promising candidate due to its high charge transport performance. Here, we prepared SnTe nanocomposites by employing an aqueous method to synthetize SnTe nanoparticles (NP), followed by a unique surface treatment prior NP consolidation. This synthetic approach allowed optimizing the charge and phonon transport synergistically. The novelty of this strategy was the use of a soluble PbS molecular complex prepared using a thiol-amine solvent mixture that upon blending is adsorbed on the SnTe NP surface. Upon consolidation with spark plasma sintering, SnTe-PbS nanocomposite is formed. The presence of PbS complexes significantly compensates for the Sn vacancy and increases the average grain size of the nanocomposite, thus improving the carrier mobility. Moreover, lattice thermal conductivity is also reduced by the Pb and S-induced mass and strain fluctuation. As a result, an enhanced ZT of ca. 0.8 is reached at 873 K. Our finding provides a novel strategy to conduct rational surface treatment on NP-based thermoelectrics.</jats:p>"

The results obtained show a maximum net generation of 6.9W in the thermoelectric generator with the finned dissipater; and 10.6W of power output in the generator with the biphasic thermosyphon.

The optimized multi-ejector system required three or four ejectors for any reference climate and was able to enhance the system performance at partial load, with a significant increase (up to 107%) of the seasonal energy efficiency ratio. The proposed system was then compared to conventional cooling technologies supplied by electric energy (electrical chillers EHP) or low-grade heat sources (absorption chillers AHP) by considering the total costs for a lifetime of 20 years and electric energy-specific costs for domestic applications from 0.10 to 0.50 €/kWhel.

The plasma gasification process was modeled under a thermo-chemical approach using aspen plus. The model validation has been carried out with experimental data from the literature, reaching an average relative error of 6.23% for temperature, heating values, and fuel species concentration of the syngas. The plasma torch power consumption was one of the main process parameters that affects the energy and exergy efficiencies. In spite of increasing moisture content of MSW, from 26.61% to 57.9%, the energy and exergy efficiencies expanded by 1.5% and 5.4% on average, respectively, which ascribed to the reduction of torch power consumption; this behavior resulted as the torches thermally degraded a lower fraction of dry MSW. Whereas, if plasma temperature increased (2500 °C to 4000 °C), the gasification efficiencies diminished because of the torch power consumption boosted by 28.3%. Furthermore, the parameter combinations process (air flow and plasma temperature) was found to reach the highest process efficiency, the efficiency ranged from 79.22% to 83.46%, highlighting the plasma gasification flexibility. The levelized cost of syngas production varied from 15.83 to 26.21 ¢US$/kW h.

This is the case for both the zinc-rich zone and the bismuth-rich zone. Texture analysis revealed the existence of two privileged orientations in the zinc zone. Gravitational segregation also resulted in a strong rearrangement of the heavier bismuth to the outer end of the sample, leaving only very fine precipitates in the zinc region. For comparison, the results obtained for the crystallization under normal gravity are given. The effect of high orderliness of the structure was then absent. Despite segregation, a significant part of bismuth remained in the form of precipitates in the zinc matrix, and the separation border was shaped like a lens. The described method can be used for the production of massive bimaterials with a directed orientation of both components and a flat interface between them, such as thermo-generator elements or bimetallic electric cell parts, where the parameters (thickness) of the junction can be precisely defined at the manufacturing stage.</jats:p>"

36804,"<jats:p>The urgent energy transition needs a better penetration of renewable energy in the world’s energy mix. The intermittency of renewables requires the use of longer-term storage. The present system uses water displacement, in a lined rock cavern or in an aerial pressurised vessel, as the virtual piston of compressor and expander functions in a carbon dioxide heat pump cycle (HPC) and in an organic transcritical cycle (OTC). Within an impermeable membrane, carbon dioxide is compressed and expanded by filling and emptying pumped-hydro water. Carbon dioxide exchanges heat with two atmospheric thermal storage pits. The hot fluid and ice pits are charged by the HPC when renewable energy becomes available and discharged by the OTC when electricity is needed. A numerical model was built to replicate the system’s losses and to calculate its round-trip efficiency (RTE). A subsequent parametric study highlights key parameters for sizing and optimisation. With an expected RTE of around 70%, this CO2 PHES (pumped-hydro electricity storage) coupled with PTES (pumped thermal energy storage) could become a game-changer by allowing the efficient storage of intermittent renewable energy and by integrating with district heating and cooling networks, as required by cities and industry in the future.</jats:p>"

The mechanical alloying successfully prepared the tetrahedrites doped with Te at the Sb sites without secondary phases, and the hot pressing produced densely sintered bodies with a relative density &gt;99.7%. As the Te content increased, the lattice constant increased from 1.0334 to 1.0346 nm, confirming the successful substitution of Te at the Sb sites. Te-doped tetrahedrites exhibited p-type characteristics, which were confirmed by the positive signs of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients. The carrier concentration decreased but the mobility increased with Te content. The electrical conductivity was relatively constant at 323–723 K, and decreased with Te substitution from 2.6 × 104 to 1.6 × 104 Sm-1 at 723 K.

During cooling, a decrease from 130 μV/K (in a stabilised measurement) to 7 μV/K (5 K/min cooling rate) was observed.

               <jats:p>This article explores the optimization of plant characteristics and controller parameters for electrified mobility. Electrification of mobile transportation systems, such as automobiles and aircraft, presents the ability to improve key performance metrics such as efficiency and cost. However, the strong bidirectional coupling between electrical and thermal dynamics within new components creates integration challenges, increasing component degradation, and reducing performance. Diminishing these issues requires novel plant designs and control strategies. The electrified mobility literature provides prior studies on plant and controller optimization, known as control co-design (CCD). A void within these studies is the lack of model predictive control (MPC), recognized to manage multi-domain dynamics for electrified systems, within CCD frameworks. This article addresses this through three contributions. First, a thermo-electromechanical hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) powertrain model is developed that is suitable for both plant optimization and MPC. Second, simultaneous plant and controller optimization is performed for this multi-domain system. Third, MPC is integrated within a CCD framework using the candidate HEV powertrain model. Results indicate that optimizing both the plant and MPC parameters simultaneously can reduce physical component sizes by over 60% and key performance metric errors by over 50%.</jats:p>"

This analysis indicated that the weighted average WF of NM beef cattle was 28,203 L/kgmeat. The majority of the WF was accounted for green water (82%; 23,063 L/kgmeat) used by rangeland forages. Blue water accounted for only 18% (5140 L/kgmeat) of the total beef WF estimate. The relative contribution of green vs. blue water varied significantly among the different phases of beef production. In cow-calf, green water accounted for 99.5% of the WF whereas blue water, accounted for 100% of beef WF during backgrounding and feedlot. Based on our estimate, NM cow-calf operations is about a third or a quarter of the blue water (m3/year) used to produce corn or wheat, and only 5% or less of the water used to produce cotton or hay.

Graphene absorbs 980 nm pump light, and uses the heat generated by ohmic heating to switch on and off the signal light at 1550 nm.

In conditions where computation load increases in micro design systems, chips must operate in environments that are narrow, sealed, and have no convection, which can drastically increase the thermal load within a system. If no proper cooling system is utilized, the system fails or operates at impacted performance due to excessive temperatures. To solve the aforementioned problem, this study aimed to optimize the design of the cooling system in the T/R modules of communications systems by integrating heat pipes, cooling fans, cooling fins, and cooling chips within a limited space. We also proposed four types of cold plates based on the different directional clamp-in configuration methods of heat pipes within copper panels and utilized the finite element method to simulate and analyze the heat dissipation performance. The simulation results reveal that cold plates of types I and II can achieve a better heat dissipation performance. Finally, types I and II cold plates were selected for production and experimental verification. The results show that heat dissipation performances were similar to simulation results. The results also confirmed that type II cold plate has a better temperature uniformity and heat transfer efficiency. Thus, the cooling mechanism depicted in this study is viable in practical applications. The proposed mechanisms can also provide a reference for heat dissipation design patterns in different electronic module settings.</jats:p>"

36986,"<jats:p> This work is aimed at establishing a unified fractional thermoelastic model for piezoelectric structures, and shedding light on the influence of different definitions on the transient responses. Theoretically, based upon Cattaneo-type equation, a unified form of fractional heat conduction law is proposed by adopting Caputo Fabrizio fractional derivative, Atangana Baleanu fractional derivative and Tempered Caputo fractional derivative. Then, thermoelastic model of fractional order is formulated for piezoelastic materials by combining the unified heat conduction law and the governing equations of elastic and electric fields. Numerically, the present theoretical model is applied to study the transient responses of piezoelectric medium that is subjected to a thermal shock. The governing equations are analytically derived and numerically solved with the aids of Laplace transform method. The obtained results are graphically illustrated, and the influences of different definitions of fractional derivative and different fractional order are revealed. This work may be helpful for understanding the multi-coupling effect of elastic, thermal and electric fields, and for inspiring further developments of fractional calculus. </jats:p>"

Based on the preliminary DFT results, which indicate the instability of Sb-doped copper chalcogenide, the Cu1.97S–Cu12Sb4S13 and Cu2−xSe–Cu3SbSe3 composites are obtained using melt-solidification techniques, with the tetrahedrite phase concentration varying from 1 to 10 wt.%. Room temperature structural analysis (XRD, SEM) indicates the two-phase structure of the materials, with ternary phase precipitates embed within the copper chalcogenide matrix. The proposed solution allows for successful blocking of excessive Cu migration, with stable electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient values over subsequent thermal cycles. The materials exhibit a p-type, semimetallic character with high stability, represented by a near-constant power factor (PF)—temperature dependences between individual cycles. Finally, the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT parameter reaches about 0.26 (623 K) for the Cu1.97S–Cu12Sb4S13 system, in which case increasing content of tetrahedrite is a beneficial effect, and about 0.44 (623 K) for the Cu2−xSe–Cu3SbSe3 system, where increasing the content of Cu3SbSe3 negatively influences the thermoelectric performance.</jats:p>"

In the current work, experimental investigation of the effect of TMT pull on the resulting welding distortions is studied and also the TMT process is compared with a heat sinking technique. The experimental results indicate that an increase in the TMT pull would reduce the extent of weld-induced buckling distortions. The results also suggest that a complicated heat sinking technique can be effectively replaced by a TMT process in reducing the welding out-of-plane distortions.

               <jats:p>Fuel cells are chemical energy converted to electric energy, which is today a new technology in energy production. Among the existing fuel cells, solid fuel oxide cells have a high potential for use in synthetic and combined production systems due to their high temperature (700–1000°C). The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) output acts as a high-temperature source, which can be used for heat engines such as the Stirling engine as a high-temperature heat source. A hybrid system including solid oxide fuel cell and Stirling engine and reverse osmosis desalinating is a cogeneration plant. This system includes two parts for power generation; the first part is power generated in the SOFC, and the second part is that with use of heat rejection of solid oxide fuel cell to generate power in the Stirling engine. Also, due to the water critical situation in the world and the need for freshwater, it is very common to use desalination systems. In this study, important goals such as power density and exergy destruction, and exergy efficiency, have been investigated. In general, the performance of the hybrid system has been investigated. Firstly, a thermodynamic analysis for all components of the system and then multi-objective optimization performed for several objective functions include exergy destruction density, exergy efficiency, fuel cell power and freshwater production rate. The present optimization is performed for two overall purposes; the first purpose is to improve fuel cell output power, exergy efficiency and exergy destruction density, and the second purpose is to improve the exergy efficiency, the amount of freshwater production and exergy destruction density. In this optimization, three robust decision-making methods TOPSIS, LINMAP and FUZZY are used. Two scenarios are presented; the first scenario is covering power, exergy efficiency and exergy destruction density. The output power and exergy efficiency, and exergy destruction density, have optimum values in the TOPSIS method’s results. The values are 939.393 (kW), 0.838 and 1139.85 (w/m2) respectively. In the second scenario that includes the freshwater production rate, the exergy destruction density and exergy efficiency, three objective functions are at their peak in the FUZZY results, which are 5.697 (kg/s), 7561.192 (w/m2) and 0.7421 respectively.</jats:p>"

Sb2Se3 materials have low electrical conductivity which limits application to the thermoelectric generator. To improve the electrical conductivity of the Sb2Se3 and β-Cu2Se nanowires, polyaniline (PANI) is coated onto the surface and confirmed via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), FE-TEM, and XPS analysis.

The HMWCNTs/epoxy composite was prepared using a multi-dispersion method, followed by uniform coating at the mid-layers of the CF/E prepregs interface using the spray coating technique. Analysis methods, such as double cantilever beam (DCB) and end notched flexure (ENF) tests, were carried out to study the mode I and II fracture toughness. The surface morphology of the composite was analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The DCB test showed that the fracture toughness of the 0.2 wt.% and 0.4 wt.% HMWCNT composite laminates was improved by 39.15% and 115.05%, respectively, compared with the control sample. Furthermore, the ENF test showed that the mode II interlaminar fracture toughness for the composite laminate increased by 50.88% and 190%, respectively. The FESEM morphology results confirmed the HMWCNTs bridging at the fracture zones of the CF/E composite and the improved interlaminar fracture toughness. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results demonstrated a strong intermolecular bonding between the epoxy and HMWCNTs, resulting in an improved thermal stability. Moreover, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results confirmed that the addition of HMWCNT shifted the Tg to a higher temperature. An electrical conductivity study demonstrated that a higher CNT concentration in the composite laminate resulted in a higher conductivity improvement. This study confirmed that the demonstrated dispersion technique could create composite laminates with a strong interfacial bond interaction between the epoxy and HMWCNT, and thus improve their properties.</jats:p>"

In this work, we proposed a multi-objective optimization strategy by using the finite element method to evaluate the structural reliability of a TE module, which integrates the module mounting mode, configurational structure of ceramic substrates, thickness of ceramic substrates and electrodes, cross-sectional shape of TE legs, and gaps between [Formula: see text]- and [Formula: see text]-type legs.

Nevertheless, currently, an investment in such a kind of power plant might not be profitable enough, since some energy policies have led to a general decrease of both the average single national price of electricity (PUN) and its variability; moreover, in several countries, negative prices are reached on some sunny or windy days. Within this context, combined heat and power (CHP) systems appear not just as a fuel-efficient way to fulfill local thermal demand but also as a sustainable way to maintain installed capacity able to support electricity grid reliability. Innovative solutions to increase both the efficiency and flexibility of those power plants, as well as careful evaluations of the economic context, are essential to ensure the sustainability of the economic investment in a fast-paced changing energy field. This study aims to evaluate the economic viability and environmental impact of an integrated solution of a cogenerative combined cycle gas turbine power plant with a flue gas condensing heat pump.

Pyrrolidinium and ammonium ILs effectively supported the vulcanization, reducing the optimal vulcanization time and temperature of NR compounds and increasing the crosslink density of the vulcanizates. Consequently, vulcanizates with these ILs exhibited higher tensile strength than the benchmark without IL. On the other hand, sulfonium ILs reduced the torque increment owing to the lower crosslinking degree of elastomer but significantly improved the resistance of NR composites to thermo-oxidation. Thus, TFSI ILs can be used to align the curing behavior and performance of NR composites for particular applications.</jats:p>"

The displacement field is acquired using the first-order shear deformation theory, and the Hamilton principle is applied to deduce the motion equations. Temperature-dependent material properties of the functionally graded material plate are used, and these properties follow the power-law distributions along the thickness direction. However, the properties of piezoelectric material layers are assumed to be independent of the electric field and temperature. Finite element formulation for the functionally graded piezoelectric material plate is done using the combined effect of mechanical and electrical loads. The effects of parameters like electrical loading, volume fraction exponent N, and temperature distribution on the static and free vibration characteristics of the functionally graded piezoelectric material square plate are analyzed and presented. Responses are obtained in terms of the centerline deflection, axial stress and the nondimensional natural frequency with various boundary conditions. It is observed that the centerline deflection and nondimensional natural frequency increases as exponent N increases. At the same time, the axial stress decreases with an increase in exponent N. The findings of the static and the free vibration analysis suggest the potential application of the functionally graded piezoelectric material plate in the piezoelectric actuator as well as for sensing deflection in bimorph. </jats:p>"

Using PbSe doped with Na, Ag, and K as a model material system, we combine original computational, experimental, and microscopy data with established trends in material behavior, to provide an in-depth discussion of the relationship between dopants, processing, and microstructure, and their effects on thermoelectric efficiency and thermal stability. Notable observations include differences in the microstructure and mass loss of thermally treated samples of Na- and Ag-doped PbSe, as well as findings that Na and K cations exist predominantly as substitutional point defects while Ag also occupies interstitial sites and exhibits lower solubility. We discuss how these differences in point defect populations are known to affect a dopants’ ability to alter carrier concentration and how they may affect the mechanical properties of PbSe during processing.</jats:p>

The expedited aging experiments of water-tree growth are performed with a water-knife electrode and analyzed in consistence with the mechanical performances evaluated by means of dynamic thermo-mechanical analysis (DMA) and tensile stress–strain characteristics. Due to the dense cross-linking network of polyethylene molecular chains formed on the TMPTA-modified surfaces of SiO2 nanofillers, TMPTA-s-SiO2 nanofillers are chemically introduced into XLPE matrix to acquire higher crosslinking degree and connection strength in the amorphous regions between polyethylene lamellae, accounting for the higher water-tree resistance and ameliorated mechanical performances, compared with pure XLPE and neat-SiO2/XLPE nanocomposite. Hydrophilic TMPTA molecules grafted on the nano-SiO2 surface can inhibit the condensation of water molecules into water micro-beads at insulation defects, thus attenuating the damage of water micro-beads to polyethylene configurations under alternating electric fields and thus restricting water-tree growth in amorphous regions. The intensified interfaces between TMPTA-s-SiO2 nanofillers and XLPE matrix limit the segment motions of polyethylene molecular chains and resist the diffusion of water molecules in XLPE amorphous regions, which further contributes to the excellent water-tree resistance of TMPTA-s-SiO2/XLPE nanocomposites.</jats:p>"

Firstly, we prepared the Al2O3 and SiO2 NFs of different concentrations (0.2 to 2.0 weight %) by ultrasonic-assisted dispersion of Al2O3 and SiO2 NPs with water as the base fluid. The thermo-physical (viscosity, activation energy, and thermal conductivity), electrical (AC conductivity and dielectric constant) and physical (ultrasonic velocity, density, refractive index) and stability characteristics were comparatively evaluated. The Al2O3 and SiO2 NPs were then catalytically activated by loading silver NPs to obtain Al2O3/SiO2@Ag composite NPs. The catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) with Al2O3/SiO2@Ag based NFs was followed. The catalytic efficiency of Al2O3@Ag NF and SiO2@Ag NF, for the 4-NP catalysis, is compared.

Selection of novel halo/thermo-tolerant bacteria from the rhizosphere of glicophytes and halophytes, grown on soil compost amended and watered with 150/300 mM NaCl, was the main objective of our study. Beneficial effects on the biomass, well-being and resilience, exerted on the assayed crops (maize, tomato, sunflower and quinoa), were clearly observable when soils were amended with 20% compost despite the very high soil electric conductivity (EC). Soil compost amendment not only was able to increase crop growth and biomass, but also their resilience to the stress caused by very high soil EC (up to 20 dS m−1). Moreover, compost amendment has proved itself a valuable source of highly halo-(4.0 M NaCl)/thermo tolerant rhizobacteria (55 °C), showing typical PGP features. Among the 13 rhizobacterial isolates, molecularly and biochemically characterized, two bacterial strains showed several biochemical PGP features. The use of compost is growing all around the world reducing considerably for farmers soil fertilization costs. In fact, only in Italy its utilization has ensured, in the last years, a saving of 650 million euro for the farmers, without taking into account the environment and human health benefits.

In this paper, the transient thermal and structural analyses of a 19-stage intermediate pressure (IP) steam turbine in various startup operating modes are discussed in detail. The presented research is based on previous investigations and utilizes a hybrid finite element method (HFEM—numerical FEM and analytical) approach to efficiently determine the time-dependent temperature distribution in the components of the steam turbine. The simulation strategy of the HFEM model applies various analytical correlations to describe heat transfer in the turbine channel. These are developed by means of extensive unsteady multistage conjugate heat transfer (CHT) simulations for both startup turbine operation with steam and prewarming operation with hot air. Moreover, the complex numerical setup of the HFEM model also considers the thermal contact resistance (TCR) on the surfaces between vane and casing as well as blades and rotor. Prior to the analysis of other turbine startup operating modes, the typical startup turbine process is calculated and validated against an experimental data as a benchmark for subsequent analysis. In addition to heat transfer correlations, the simulation of a turbine startup from cold state uses an innovative analytic pressure model to allow for a consideration of condensation effects during first phase of startup procedure. Finally, the presented thermal investigation focuses on the comparison of transient temperature fields in the turbine for different startup scenarios after prewarming with hot air and provides the subsequent structural investigation with required boundary conditions. As a result, the values of the highest stress are numerically determined and compared to the values obtained by means of cold startup simulation. The final evaluation clearly displays the technical potential and the benefits of the prewarming concept.</jats:p>"

37238,"<jats:p> Traditional electro-thermal de-icing strategy has the drawback of high energy consumption and its heat knife accounts for a considerable amount of the cost. Compared to electro-thermal de-icing, thermo-mechanical expulsion de-icing system eliminates the heat knife by combining electric-heating with electro-magnetic expulsion de-icing system. The consumption is significantly lower but the system has complex mechanical structures. In this article, a novel de-icing strategy combining electric-heating with plasma synthetic jet actuator is proposed for the first time. Its main idea is to replace heat knife with a simple mechanical device. During the de-icing process, the electric-heating is used to remove the adhesion force, then a single pulse of plasma synthetic jet actuator exerts a rapid force on ice and makes it fracture. Schlieren imaging shows plasma synthetic jet actuator can make free ice columns fracture into pieces and powder. The ice can even be completely penetrated by pressurized air when the discharge energy is relatively large. And compared with the non-deicing process, the intensities of waves and jets are significantly weakened. During the hybrid de-icing process, high-speed photography shows that plasma synthetic jet actuator can divide an ice layer 200 mm in diameter and 10 mm in thickness into multiple blocks completely in tens of milliseconds after electric-heating removes the adhesion force. Besides, energy consumption of plasma synthetic jet actuator in a de-icing cycle accounts for only 0.27% of the whole system. Compared with the free ice columns of the same size, the ice debonded by electric-heating fragmented into smaller blocks after activating plasma synthetic jet actuator. However, heating for too long does not bring more beneficial effects on the fracture of ice in this experiment. At last, a new “micro piston ice-breaker” which is waterproof is proposed to meet the needs of in-flight de-icing. </jats:p>"

Simulations of the six different modules under the same heat flux was carried out in ANSYS 2020 R2 software. Temperature and voltage distributions were obtained for each model and the results indicate significant variations due to the utilization of varying leg geometries. Results show that the X-X leg module generated the highest temperature gradient and electric voltage. In comparison, a temperature gradient and electric voltage of 297 K and 16 V, respectively were achieved with the X-X leg module as against 182 K and 8.4 V, respectively, achieved in a conventional rectangular leg module.

Herein, taking BiCuSeO superlattice as an example, it is demonstrated that efficient interlayer charge release can increase carrier concentration, thereby activating multiple Fermi pockets through Bi/Cu dual vacancies and Pb codoping. Experimental results reveal that the extrinsic charges, which are introduced by Pb and initially trapped in the charge-reservoir [Bi2O2]2+ sublayers, are effectively released into [Cu2Se2]2− sublayers via the channels bridged by Bi/Cu dual vacancies. This efficient interlayer charge release endows dual-vacancy- and Pb-codoped BiCuSeO with increased carrier concentration and electrical conductivity. Moreover, with increasing carrier concentration, the Fermi level is pushed down, activating multiple converged valence bands, which helps to maintain a relatively high Seebeck coefficient and yield an enhanced power factor. As a result, a high ZT value of ∼1.4 is achieved at 823 K in codoped Bi0.90Pb0.06Cu0.96SeO, which is superior to that of pristine BiCuSeO and solely doped samples.

In particular, electric vehicles have a higher environmental impact during the production phase, which should be balanced by a lower impact during the service life by means of a lightweight design. As an example of an ultraefficient electric vehicle, a prototype for the Shell Eco-marathon competition is considered. A “tank-to-wheel” multiphysics model (thermo-electro-mechanical) of the vehicle was developed in “Matlab-Simscape”. The model includes the battery, the DC motors, the motor controller and the vehicle drag forces. A preliminary model validation was performed by considering experimental data acquisitions completed during the 2019 Shell Eco-marathon European competition at the Brooklands Circuit (UK). Numerical simulations are employed to assess the sharing of the energy consumption among the main dissipation sources. From the analysis, we found that the main sources of mechanical dissipation (i.e., rolling resistance, gravitational/inertial force and aerodynamic drag) have the same role in the defining the power consumption of such kind of vehicles. Moreover, the effect of the main vehicle parameters (i.e., mass, aerodynamic coefficient and tire rolling resistance coefficient) on the energy consumption was analyzed through a sensitivity analysis. Results showed a linear correlation between the variation of the parameters and the power demand, with mass exhibiting the highest influence. The results of this study provide fundamental information to address critical decisions for designing new and more efficient lightweight vehicles, as they allow the designer to clearly identify which are the main parameters to keep under control during the design phase and which are the most promising areas of action.</jats:p>"

The experiment is a vertical Rijke tube containing an electric heater. The heater drives a base flow via natural convection, and thermoacoustic oscillations via velocity-driven heat release fluctuations. The decay rates and frequencies of these oscillations are measured every few seconds by acoustically forcing the system via a loudspeaker placed at the bottom of the tube. More than 320,000 temperature measurements are used to compute state and parameters of the base flow model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. A wave-based network model is then used to describe the acoustics inside the tube. We balance momentum and energy at the boundary between two adjacent elements, and model the viscous and thermal dissipation mechanisms in the boundary layer and at the heater and thermocouple locations. Finally, we tune the parameters of two different thermoacoustic models on an experimental dataset that comprises more than 40,000 experiments. This study shows that, with thorough Bayesian inference, a qualitative model can become quantitatively accurate, without overfitting, as long as it contains the most influential physical phenomena.</jats:p>"

The results indicate that in spite of a good heating performance in heating process, the PW/SA composite induces an even higher temperature difference over the battery pack. Although PW/EG composite causes a large temperature difference at the end of heating film heating, it can quickly restore the uniformity of the battery pack.

Chinese rice wine (CRW) is a traditional wine prevalent in East Asia. In current industrial production of bottled CRW, an additional thermal pasteurization is required at the bottling stage to extend the shelf life of the product, and this thermal treatment results in quality degradation and even carcinogen formation. In our previous studies, non-thermal technologies such as pulsed electric fields (PEF), thermosonication (TS), and their combination (TS-PEF) have been shown to significantly inactivate Saccharomyces cerevisiae in CRW as an alternative to thermal pasteurization of bottled wine. However, studies of their effects on the quality of CRW are very limited. In this study, we compared the physicochemical properties of CRW treated by pasteurization, PEF, TS, and TS-PEF. The results showed that the basic physicochemical indicators of CRW (total sugar, non-sugar solids, total acidity, amino acid nitrogen, and pH) did not change significantly after all these treatments. The TS-PEF treatment reduced the total color difference caused by the TS or PEF treatments. However, corrosion of the electrodes during PEF and TS-PEF treatment caused a significant increase in iron, chromium, and nickel concentrations. In addition, volatile flavor compounds, such as alcohols, esters, acids, and aldehydes, were reduced much more after TS and TS-PEF treatment than after pasteurization and PEF. Further research is needed on minimizing the negative impacts of these new technologies on the flavor of CRW in the context of effective sterilization.

               <jats:p>Petrol vapor emissions are the main source of pollution for both standard and hybrid vehicles. They are mainly generated by gasoline evaporation from the fuel tank of both running and parked vehicles; it is mostly driven by fuel temperature variation due to daily temperature changes (if parked) and heat from engine (if running). To prevent its dispersion in the environment, the vapor generated in the fuel tank is usually stored in a carbon canister filter that must be periodically “purged” in order to prevent its saturation, by venting it to the intake manifold. Canister management, made by the Engine Control Unit (ECU), becomes even more critical for hybrid-electric vehicles because thermal engine is often off, thus purging cannot take place. A pressurized fuel tank is often used for hybrid applications, to further isolate vapor from environment, making the fuel system even more complex to model. System design optimization is usually based on experience and experimental correlations, which require time and cost. Thus, comes the need for a comprehensive predictive model useful for both vehicle components (fuel tank and carbon canister) and ECU software design.</jats:p>
               <jats:p>A 0D Matlab® model is proposed, which can predict vapor generation from an arbitrary tank in standard and arbitrary thermal cycles, with arbitrary tank capacity, geometry and construction and at different filling levels. It is based on a system of thermo-fluid-dynamic differential equations and semi-empirical correlations that is iteratively solved in time. Model calibration has been performed by using a small size test tank and validation has been completed on full size tanks for both standard and hybrid-electric applications. The main driving force for vapor generation has been shown to be the amount of empty volume on top of the tank; other significant effects come from tank volume, material, external surface as well as fuel properties. Ongoing work is to develop and integrate a carbon canister loading/purging model, with the aim to build a full model of the vapor system.</jats:p>"

Thermo-physiological comfort is associated with the effective heat transfer between the body and the atmosphere, maintaining the body temperature in a tolerable thermal range (36.5–37.5ºC). In order to ensure comfort, the body heat must be preserved or emitted, depending on external conditions. If the body heat is not properly managed, it can cause hyperthermia, heatstroke, and thermal discomfort. Conventionally, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are used to provide comfort. However, they require a huge amount of energy, leading to an increase in global warming, and are limited to indoor applications. In recent decades, scientists across the world have been working to provide thermal comfort through wearable innovative textiles.

Therefore, identifying the optimal leg configuration that attains the best performance is essential. The present work considers several leg configurations by the volume reduction of the conventional prism leg, without changing the shape class via decreasing basic dimensions (i.e. leg height or cross-sectional area) and with morphing the original prism into X and trapezoidal shapes. A three-dimensional thermo-electric model is developed to investigate the performance of TEG legs at the uni-thermocouple level. Besides, to determine the reliability of the proposed configurations, a wide range of thermal boundary conditions are applied on the hot side to resemble the realistic working environment that TEG might experience at room temperature on the cold side with natural convective cooling. The model is numerically simulated after being validated with the available experimental and numerical data. The comparison indicates that decreasing leg height adversely affects the TEG performance, whereas a significant enhancement in the performance is achieved (in order) for X, trapezoidal and reduced area shapes. However, the performance enhancement, i.e. power and efficiency, associated with the simple reduced area configuration is relatively close to those achieved by X or trapezoidal ones, raising many questions in terms of simplicity and manufacturing cost. The performed research further deepens our understanding of TEG performance enhancement via optimizing legs’ attributes at uni-thermocouple as a single building block of the full-size TEG module.</jats:p>"

The derived systems of nonlinear vibration models are solved with the aid of the Galerkin decomposition and the homotopy perturbation method. Effects of temperature, magnetic field, multi-layer, and other thermomechanical parameters on the dynamic responses of the slightly curved multi-walled carbon nanotubes are investigated and discussed. As the temperature increases, the frequency ratio decreases as the linear natural frequency of the system increases. The results reveal that the frequency ratios decrease as the number of nanotube walls, temperature, spring constants, magnetic field strength, and the ratio of the radius of curvature to the length of the slightly curved nanotubes increase. These trends are the same for all the boundary conditions considered. However, clamped-simple and clamped-clamped supported multi-walled nanotube have the highest and lowest frequency ratio, respectively. Also, from the parametric studies to control nonlinear vibration of the carbon nanotubes, it is shown that quadruple-walled carbon nanotubes can be taken as pure linear vibration even at any value of linear Winkler and Pasternak constants. Therefore, this can be used for the restraining of the chaos vibration in the objective structure. These research findings will assist the designers and manufacturers in developing multi-walled carbon nanotubes for various structural, electrical, mechanical, and biological applications, especially in the areas of designing nanoelectronics, nanodevices, nanomechanical systems, nanobiological devices, and nanocomposites, and particularly when they are subjected to thermal loads, magnetic fields and elastic foundations."

Bearing failure is one of the leading causes of derailments that result in significant capital loss and in extreme cases tragic human loss. The two widely used bearing health monitoring systems are the Trackside Acoustic Detection System (TADS™) and the wayside Hot-Box Detector (HBD). These systems are reactive in nature and only give alerts when the bearings are nearing failure. To supplant that, a prototype wireless onboard condition monitoring system was developed by researchers at the University Transportation Center for Railway Safety (UTCRS). This onboard wireless system can detect bearing defects at their early stages of initiation so that proactive maintenance actions can be taken by the railroads and railcar owners. Due to the wireless nature of this system, a constant power supply is needed to ensure its continued operation.</jats:p>

Implementation of a suitable energy harvesting device can significantly increase the longevity of the batteries used in the wireless module, and in ideal operating conditions, generate consistent energy rendering the battery as a temporary energy storage device. The proposed energy harvesting device consists of thermoelectric generators, aluminum heat sinks, a switching boost convertor, and a battery management chip. This device was tested on a dynamic bearing test rig to assess the performance of the thermoelectric generators. To best simulate field operation conditions, the thermoelectric generators were placed on opposite sides of the bearing adapter; one exposed to direct forced convection while the other side is shielded by the adapter and experiences minimal convection. Thermoelectric generators were found to be an effective solution due to their ability to convert a temperature gradient into a usable voltage sufficient to charge the battery. The buck booster converter increases the voltage from the thermoelectric generators to 5-volts so that the battery management chip can regulate the voltage and efficiently charge the battery. This paper summarizes the performance of the thermoelectric modules under different operating conditions. The main goal of this project is to devise an energy harvesting device that allows the wireless module to be self-powered utilizing the heat generated from the bearing and the charge held by the battery as a hybrid power source.</jats:p>"

<jats:p>With the rapid development of nanotechnology, stimulus-responsive nanofibers have in recent
years, aroused the interest of many researchers. Due to their biocompatibility, favorable safety,
and easy degradability, thermo-sensitive hydrogels, which are responsive to temperature change, have
become increasingly attractive in the biomedicine field. Electrospinning is a unique fibrous manufacturing
process in which a polymer solution is spun under a strong electric field to form into nanofibers.
The porous structure and large surface area of electrospun nanofibers contribute significantly to the
application of thermo-sensitive hydrogels in drug release systems, wound dressing materials, and biosensors.
In the first part of this study, the mechanism of temperature sensitivity is detailed. Then the
classification and preparation of electrospun thermo-sensitive hydrogels nanofibers are illustrated, followed
by an introduction of their current applications in biomedical science. Finally, the current limitations
and promise of electrospun thermo-sensitive hydrogels nanofibrous materials are presented.</jats:p>

37421,"<jats:p>Piezoelectric materials are widely fabricated and investigated for potential applications in microelectromechanical systems as direct converters between mechanical and electrical signals, where some show pyroelectric features involving thermo-electro-mechanical interactions. This study aimed to introduce a novel numerical technique to predict the thermo-electro-mechanical behaviors of piezoelectric structures, based on a strong-form numerical framework called the element differential method. In this method, the shape functions of the isoparametric element and their first two derivatives were derived analytically by interpolating the temperature, displacement, and electric potentials. Then, a point collocation method based on node positions in the elements was proposed to generate the final system of equations without any domain integrations. Thus, the coupled behaviors of thermal piezoelectric structures, including the pyroelectric features, can be simulated by the strong-form formulation of the governing equations. Several numerical examples, including the piezoelectric composites structures, are presented, and the coupled thermo-electro-mechanical responses have been analyzed to validate the proposed method.</jats:p>"

The method is based on in-situ measurement of the module’s dark current-voltage (I-V) characteristic curve during the stress test, as well as initial and final module flash testing on a Sun simulator. The method uses superposition of the dark I-V curve with final flash test module short-circuit current to account for shunt and junction recombination losses, as well as series resistance estimation from the in-situ measured dark I-Vs and final flash test measurements. The method is developed based on mc-Si standard modules undergoing several stages of thermo-mechanical stress testing and degradation, for which we investigate the impact of the degradation on the modules light I-V curve parameters, and equivalent solar cell model parameters. Experimental validation of the method on the modules tested shows good agreement between the in-situ estimated power degradation and the flash test measured power loss of the modules, of up to 4.31 % error (RMSE), as the modules experience primarily junction defect recombination and increased series resistance losses. However, the application of the method will be limited for modules experiencing extensive photo-current degradation or delamination, which are not well reflected in the dark I-V characteristic of the PV module.</jats:p>"

The experimental results showed that in both thermal fields, Ca and C inter-diffused at a lower temperature, but at a higher temperature, the formed calcium carbide crystals would have a negative effect on Ca diffusion to carbon. The significant enhancement of MW heating on carbon diffusion, thus on the more efficient synthesis of calcium carbide, manifested that MW heating would be a promising way for calcium carbide production, and that a sufficient enough carbon material, instead of CaO, was beneficial for calcium carbide formation in MW reactors.</jats:p>"

The standard service life of such cables is at least 30 years (subject to the conditions of storage, transportation, installation and operation), and the actual one   is determined by the technical condition of the cable. The service life of a cable line depends on the state of its insulation, the aging of which occurs under the influence of several factors. Conventionally, all factors influencing one or another degree on the cable insulation resource can be divided into thermal, electromagnetic, climatic, mechanical and operational. The most significant reason for the insulation aging  is high temperature, which accelerates the reaction of thermo-oxidative destruction, during which high-molecular polymer compounds decompose. In fact, cables are operated at temperatures below the long-term permissible values, and, therefore, the aging of the insulation is slower, and the actual service life will be longer than the standard. At present, condition of the insulation is monitored with the use of high voltage tests related to destructive testing methods. When designing and operating cable lines, it is necessary to estimate the duration of the actual service life under various operating conditions. In theory, there are several expressions for calculating the service life of a cable line when exposed to temperature, humidity, electric field and aggressive environments, but all of them are not applicable in practice due to the presence of a large number of coefficients whose values are unknown. The paper presents an analytical expression obtained for determining the service life of power electric cables, taking into account the aging of the insulation under the influence of temperature and electric field.</jats:p>"

Thermo-inertial convection is a distinctive flow regime on the border between rotating thermal convection and wave propagation. It occurs in astrophysical and geophysical contexts where self-sustained or external magnetic fields are commonly present. To investigate the onset of motion, a perturbation method is used here with an inviscid balance in the leading order and a buoyancy force acting against weak viscous dissipation in the next order of approximation. Analytical evaluation of constituent integral quantities is enabled by applying a Green’s function method for the exact solution of the heat equation following our earlier non-magnetic analysis. Results for the case of thermally infinitely conducting boundaries and for the case of nearly thermally insulating boundaries are obtained. In both cases, explicit expressions for the dependence of the Rayleigh number on the azimuthal wavenumber are derived in the limit of high thermal diffusivity. It is found that an imposed azimuthal magnetic field exerts a stabilizing influence on the onset of inertial convection and as a consequence magneto-inertial convection with azimuthal wave number of unity is generally preferred.</jats:p>"

The mechanics incorporate coupling between mechanical, electric, and thermal fields and encompass geometric nonlinearity effects due to large quasi-static displacements and rotations. The governing equations are formulated explicitly in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates and combined with the kinematic assumptions of a mixed-field shear-layerwise shell laminate theory. Based on the above mechanics and adopting the finite element methodology, an eight-node nonlinear shell element is developed to yield the linearized discrete coupled small-amplitude dynamic equations of motion. Initially, the nonlinear coupled equations are linearized and solved quasi-statically using an extended cylindrical arc-length method in combination with the Newton–Raphson iterative technique, and subsequently the free vibration analysis is performed at each solution point. Validation and evaluation cases on laminated cylindrical shells demonstrate the accuracy of the present method and its robust capability to predict the modal response on top of the nonlinear quasi-static response of active multistable shells subject to combined thermo–piezo–electromechanical loads. Numerical cases show the feasibility to develop smart shell structures to detect, via the monitoring of natural frequencies, the onset of snap-through instability. The capability of smart shells to actively modify its natural frequencies such as to promote or mitigate snap-through instabilities is quantified. Additional results quantify the effect of thermomechanical loads on actuation capability. The influence of geometric parameters (curvature and thickness) on the modal response is finally investigated. </jats:p>"

               <jats:p>The grain boundary groove method has been successfully used to measure solid-liquid interfacial energies, σ<jats:sub>SL</jats:sub>, experimentally for binary eutectic and peritectic systems, multi-component systems as well as pure materials and for opaque materials as well as transparent materials. It was shown that the grain boundary groove method can be use to obtain σ<jats:sub>SL</jats:sub> for any alloy system provided that the prepared alloy sample can be held at the evaluated temperature for a long enough time with a very stable temperature gradient. In order to show the applicability of the groove method to any system, a part of the Al-Zn phase diagram was chosen. Equilibrated grain boundary groove shapes for solid Alα solution (Al-30wt%Zn) in equilibrium with AlZn liquid (Al-60wt%Zn) have been directly observed with a radial heat flow apparatus. The Gibbs-Thomson coefficient, Γ, was determined with a numerical method using observed groove shapes. The measured thermal conductivities of the solid Alα solution and AlZn liquid phases and the temperature gradient in the solid phase at the solid-liquid interface were used for the calculation of Γ and then σ<jats:sub>SL</jats:sub> was determined using the Gibbs-Thomson equation. The grain boundary energy for the same system was also obtained from the observed groove shapes. The results of the work were compared with the results of the related experimental works.</jats:p>"

                  <jats:italic>FeTe, a non-superconducting parent compound in the iron-chalcogenide family, becomes superconducting after annealing in oxygen. Under the presence of magnetism, spin-orbit coupling, inhomogeneity and lattice distortion, the nature of its superconductivity is not well understood. Here we combine the mutual inductance technique with magneto transport to study the magnetization and superconductivity of FeTe thin films. It is found that the films with the highest T</jats:italic>

Such a hysteresis can be well explained by a two-level critical state model and suggests the importance of granularity to superconductivity in this compound</jats:italic>.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>Significant new functionality is reported for torsion mechanical tools aimed at full magnetic characterizations of both spin statics and dynamics in micro- and nanostructures. Specifically, two orthogonal torque directions are monitored and the results co-analyzed to separate magnetic moment and magnetic susceptibility contributions to torque, as is desired for characterization of anisotropic three-dimensional structures. The approach is demonstrated through application to shape and microstructural disorder-induced magnetic anisotropies in lithographically patterned permalloy, and will have utility for the determination of important magnetic thin-film and multilayer properties including interface anisotropy and exchange bias. The results reflect remarkable sensitivity of the out-of-plane magnetic torque to the nature of small edge domains perpendicular to the applied field direction, and also contain tantalizing indications of direct coupling to spin dynamics at the frequency of the mechanics.</jats:p>"

When the field is further increased, the crystal exhibits a negative magnetostriction curve. This phenomenon has been discussed in term of magnetic domain switching.

Second, the waste magnets maintain the physical and chemical properties of the original magnets even with deterioration of the properties on surfaces due to corrosion and contamination.

The classical materials (Ga,Mn)As of III–V group based DMSs has been well studied for its high compatibility with the high-mobility semiconductor GaAs. But the Curie temperature in (Ga,Mn)As film is still far below room temperature because the spin &amp; charge doping is bundled to the same element that makes the fabrication very difficult. Alternatively, the discovery of a new generation DMSs with independent spin and charge doping, such as (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn) <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>As<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (briefly named BZA), attracted considerable attention due to their unique advantages in physical properties and heterojunction fabrication.

               <jats:p>Magnetic orderings, i.e., the spontaneous alignment of electron spins below a critical temperature, have been playing key roles in modern science and technologies for both the wide applications of magnetic recording for information storage and the vibrant potential of solid state electronic spin devices (also known as spintronics) for logic operations. In the past decades, thanks to the development of thin film technologies, magnetic thin films via sputtering or epitaxial growth have made the spintronic devices possible at the industrial scale. Yet thinner materials at lower costs with more versatile functionalities are highly desirable for advancing future spintronics. Recently, van der Waals magnetic materials, a family of magnets that can in principle be exfoliated down to the monolayer limit, seem to have brought tremendous opportunities: new generation van der Waals spintronic devices can be seamlessly assembled with possible applications such as optoelectronics, flexible electronics, and etc. Moreover, those exfoliated spintronic devices can potentially be compatible with the famed metal-oxide field effect transistor architectures, allowing the harness of spin performances through the knob of an electrostatic field.</jats:p>"

42637,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A systems approach within an integrated computational materials engineering framework was used to design three new low-cost seamless replacement coinage alloys to reduce the raw material cost of the current US coinage alloys. Maintaining compatibility with current coinage materials required matching the currently used alloy properties of yield strength, work-hardening behavior, electrical conductivity, color, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance. In addition, the designed alloys were required to use current production processes. CALPHAD-based models for electrical conductivity and color were developed to integrate into the system design. Three prototype alloys were designed, produced, and characterized. The design process highlighted the trade-off between minimizing the raw material costs and achieving the desired color properties. Characterization of the three prototype alloys showed good agreement with the design goals.</jats:p>"

          <jats:p>The effect of a high magnetic field applied during oxidation on the structure, optical transmittance, resistivity, and magnetism of cobalt (Co)-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films prepared by oxidizing evaporated Zn/Co bilayer thin films in open air was studied. The relationship between the structure and properties of films oxidized with and without an applied magnetic field was analyzed. The results show that the high magnetic field obviously changed the structure and properties of the Co-doped ZnO films. The Lorentz force of the high magnetic field suppressed the oxidation growth on nanowhiskers. As a result, ZnO nanowires were formed without a magnetic field, whereas polyhedral particles formed under a 6 T magnetic field. This morphology variation from dendrite to polyhedron caused the transmittance below 1,200 nm of the film oxidized under a magnetic field of 6 T to be much lower than that of the film oxidized without a magnetic field. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy indicated that the high magnetic field suppressed Co substitution in the ZnO lattice, increased the concentration of oxygen vacancies, and changed the chemical state of Co. The increased concentration of oxygen vacancies affected the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the film oxidized under a magnetic field of 6 T compared with that of the film oxidized without a magnetic field. The changes of oxygen vacancy concentration and Co state caused by the application of the high magnetic field also increase the ferromagnetism of the film at room temperature. All of these results indicate that a high magnetic field is an effective tool to modify the structure and properties of ZnO thin films.</jats:p>"

43127,"<jats:p>Lithium–sulfur (Li-S) batteries, due to their high theoretical capacity, intrinsic overcharge protection, and low cost, are considered as the most promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems. To promote widespread use of Li-S batteries, various tactics have been reported to improve the columbic efficiency and to suppress the shuttle effect. Herein, we report a novel polymeric sulfur via heat radical polymerization, for the Li-S battery. The insolubles after CS2 washing, and the changes in XRD (X-ray diffraction) results imply the formation of polymeric sulfur. Owing to the absence of cyclic S8 molecular, the shuttle effect is depressed, and the polymeric sulfur cathodes exhibit lower self-discharge rates, higher sulfur utilization, better rates of performance, and enhanced cycling stabilities than the commercial sublimed sulfur. Thus, polymeric sulfur provides a new train of thought and tactics for restricting the formation of the dissolution of polysulfides, and self-discharge.</jats:p>"

Here, free-standing and low-tortuosity N, O co-doped wood-like carbon frameworks decorated with carbon nanotubes forest (WLC-CNTs) are synthesized and used as host for enabling scalable high-performance Li-sulfur batteries. EIS-symmetric cell examinations demonstrate that the ionic resistance and charge-transfer resistance per unit electro-active surface area of S@WLC-CNTs do not change with the variation of thickness, allowing the thickness-independent electrochemical performance of Li-S batteries.

Here, a magneto-induced foam, called magnetorheological (MR) foam, was fabricated with the feature of being able to tune sound absorption properties, primarily from the middle- to higher-frequency ranges. Three different samples of MR foams were fabricated in situ by varying the concentration of Carbonyl Iron Particles (CIPs) (0, 35, and 75 wt.%). The magnetization properties and tunable sound absorption characteristics were evaluated. From the magnetic saturation properties, the results showed very narrow and small coercivity of hysteresis loops relative to the soft magnetic properties of the CIPs. MR foam with 75 wt.% CIPs showed a higher magnetic saturation at 91.350 emu/g compared to MR foam with 35 wt.% CIPs at 63.896 emu/g. For tunable sound absorption testing, the effect of ‘shifting’ to higher frequency was also observed when the magnetic field was applied, which was ~10 Hz for MR foam with 35 wt.% CIPs and ~130 Hz for MR foam with 75 wt.% CIPs.

44052,"<jats:p>In this study, a novel computational method capable of reproducing hysteresis loops of hard magnetic materials is proposed. It is conceptually based on the classical Preisach model but has a completely different approach in the modeling of the hysteron effect. Indeed, the change in magnetization caused by a single hysteron is compared here to the change in velocity of two disk-shaped solids elastically colliding with each other rather than the effect of ideal geometrical entities giving rise to so-called Barkhausen jumps. This allowed us to obtain a simple differential formulation for the global magnetization equation with a significant improvement in terms of computational performance. A sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the proposed method has indeed shown the capability to model a large class of hysteresis loops. Moreover, the proposed method permits modeling of the temperature effect on magnetization of neodymium magnets, which is a key point for the design of electrical machines. Therefore, application of the proposed method to the hysteresis loop of a real NdFeB magnet has been proven to be very accurate and efficient for a large temperature range.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study is the development of a hybrid biomaterial based on chitosan (CS) and manganese ferrite (MF) for the recovery of Nd(III) ions from the aqueous phase. The preparation of the beads was performed in two stages; first, MF particles were obtained by the assessment of three temperatures during the co-precipitation synthesis, and the best nano-MF crystallites were incorporated into CS to obtain the hybrid composite material (CS-MF). The materials were characterized by FTIR, XRD, magnetization measurements, and SEM-EDX. The adsorption experiments included pH study, equilibrium study, kinetics study, and sorption–desorption reusability tests. The results showed that for MF synthesis, 60 °C is an appropriate temperature to obtain MF crystals of ~30 nm with suitable magnetic properties. The final magnetic CS-MF beads perform maximum adsorption at pH 4 with a maximum adsorption capacity of 44.29 mg/g. Moreover, the material can be used for up to four adsorption–desorption cycles. The incorporation of MF improves the sorption capacity of the neat chitosan. Additionally, the magnetic properties enable its easy separation from aqueous solutions for further use.

In addition, LiPSs shuttle effect has been inhibited without a decrease in lithium-ion transference numbers. Simultaneously, the MCCoS/PP separator with good LiPSs adsorption capability arouses redistribution and fixing of active substances, which is also beneficial to the rate performance and cycling stability.

However, from a practical perspective, these batteries exhibit poor cycle life and low energy content owing to the polysulfides shuttling during cycling. To tackle these issues, researchers proposed the use of redox-inactive protective layers between the sulfur-containing cathode and lithium metal anode. However, these interlayers provide additional weight to the cell, thus, decreasing the practical specific energy. Here, we report the development and testing of redox-active interlayers consisting of sulfur-impregnated polar ordered mesoporous silica. Differently from redox-inactive interlayers, these redox-active interlayers enable the electrochemical reactivation of the soluble polysulfides, protect the lithium metal electrode from detrimental reactions via silica-polysulfide polar-polar interactions and increase the cell capacity. Indeed, when tested in a non-aqueous Li-S coin cell configuration, the use of the interlayer enables an initial discharge capacity of about 8.5 mAh cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> (for a total sulfur mass loading of 10 mg cm<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>) and a discharge capacity retention of about 64 % after 700 cycles at 335 mA g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> and 25 °C.</jats:p>"

44114,"<jats:p> The need for faster and more miniaturized electronics is challenging scientists to develop novel forms of electronics based on quantum degrees of freedom different from electron charge. In this fast-developing field, often referred to as quantum electronics, the metal-oxide perovskite SrRuO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> can play an important role thanks to its diverse physical properties, which have been intensively investigated, mostly for conventional electronics. In addition to being chemically stable, easy to fabricate with high quality and to grow epitaxially onto many oxides—these are all desirable properties also for conventional electronics—SrRuO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> has interesting properties for quantum electronics like itinerant ferromagnetism and metallic behavior, strong correlation between magnetic anisotropy and spin–orbit coupling, strain-tunable magnetization, and anomalous Hall and Berry effects. In this Perspective, after describing the main phenomena emerging from the interplay between spin, orbital, lattice, and topological quantum degrees of freedom in SrRuO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>, we discuss the challenges still open to achieve control over these phenomena. We then provide our perspectives on the most promising applications of SrRuO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> for devices for conventional and quantum electronics.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the particle size were 48 +- 2 nm, 29 +- 2 nm and 25 +- 2 nm for the Zn1-xCrxO with x = 0, 0.03 and 0.05, respectively. TEM morphology indicated particles are agglomerated in the doped samples. The band-gap decreases slightly from 3.305 +- 0.003 eV to 3.292 +- 0.003 eV with increase of Cr content from x = 0 to 0.05, respectively.

The field-dependent magnetization measurements of ZnO and Cr-doped ZnO were carried out using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) at 300 K. All the samples exhibits ferromagnetic behavior. This long-range ferromagnetism ordering observed in ZnO is explained based on bound magnetic polaron (BMP) mechanism. The singly ionized oxygen vacancies playing a crucial role in observed room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) in ZnO. There is a sufficient amount of BMPs formed in Cr doped ZnO because of the defects present in these samples. Therefore, the overlapping of BMPs results in the RTFM.

<jats:p>Developing lightweight and broadband microwave absorbers for dealing with serious electromagnetic radiation pollution is a great challenge. Here, a novel Fe–Co/N-doped carbon/reduced graphene oxide (Fe–Co/NC/rGO) composite with hierarchically porous structure was designed and synthetized by in situ growth of Fe-doped Co-based metal organic frameworks (Co-MOF) on the sheets of porous cocoon-like rGO followed by calcination. The Fe–Co/NC composites are homogeneously distributed on the sheets of porous rGO. The Fe–Co/NC/rGO composite with multiple components (Fe/Co/NC/rGO) causes magnetic loss, dielectric loss, resistance loss, interfacial polarization, and good impedance matching. The hierarchically porous structure of the Fe–Co/NC/rGO enhances the multiple reflections and scattering of microwaves. Compared with the Co/NC and Fe–Co/NC, the hierarchically porous Fe–Co/NC/rGO composite exhibits much better microwave absorption performances due to the rational composition and porous structural design. Its minimum reflection loss (RL<jats:sub>min</jats:sub>) reaches − 43.26 dB at 11.28 GHz with a thickness of 2.5 mm, and the effective absorption frequency (RL ≤ − 10 dB) is up to 9.12 GHz (8.88–18 GHz) with the same thickness of 2.5 mm. Moreover, the widest effective bandwidth of 9.29 GHz occurs at a thickness of 2.63 mm.

However, the investigations on the high-entropy alloys with thermal- and magnetic-field-induced magnetostructural transformation are still lacking. In this work, we provide a basic strategy to design a six-component MnFeCoNiGeSi high-entropy system, exhibiting low-hysteresis magnetostructural transformation between ferromagnetic orthorhombic and paramagnetic hexagonal phases. An increase in the configurational entropy is helpful to make the alloy crystallize in the single hexagonal structure, which can almost completely transform into the orthorhombic structure during cooling. The thermal hysteresis in our high-entropy alloy is as low as about 4.3 K. This advantage guarantees reversible magnetic-field-induced magnetostructural transformation and is accompanying a large magnetocaloric effect. A reversible entropy change of −13.67 J K<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> kg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> is realized under a magnetic field variation of 0–5 T. The obtained room-temperature magnetocaloric performance is comparable to that of some rare-earth-based high-entropy alloys and conventional first-order magnetocaloric materials.

The FM ordering temperature in CrSnS3 is the highest among Cr-based Van der Waals materials: CrI3, CrSiTe3 and CrGeTe3. The dc-susceptibility revealed a sharp increase at Tc (~119K) indicative of a first order transition; then raises to a wide maximum at AFM Neel temperature TN~90K.The ac-susceptibility reveals the presence of two sharp peaks; one close to Tc (119K) and the other at TN~90K. Ac-susceptibility measurements in an applied dc-magnetic field indicates that CrSnS3 undergoes two successive phase transitions: a sharp increase in the susceptibility indicates a first order PM to FM at 119K, followed by more gradual decrease at the onset of AFM transition at TN~90K.

For these applications, SPIONs must be stable in an aqueous solution, monodisperse, with a narrow size distribution and without aggregation. To obtain these nanoparticles, a microwave process is carried out in this study as an easy, fast and reproducible synthesis method. Currently, in the literature, most synthesis of SPIONs are in ultra-pure water or another solvent. To consider the use of SPIONs in biomedical applications, it is essential to ensure the preservation of the physico-chemical parameters of the nanoparticles in the physiological medium to validate a synthesis process. With this objective, this study reports a comparison between the SPIONs synthesis in ultra-pure water and the SPIONs direct synthesis in a physiological serum (containing NaCl). To complete this comparison, the dispersion of SPIONs in physiological serum after an elaboration in ultra-pure water is reported. Characterizations of these different SPIONs samples are carried out to determine the physico-chemical parameters and magnetic properties. SPIONs are characterized by Transmission Electronic Microscopy, Dynamic Light Scattering, X-Ray Diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and magnetic measurements.

However, some technical problems such as the low conductivity of sulfur, huge volume expansion during cycling and the shuttle effect of polysulfide have prevented this kind of battery system to be commercialized. One method to solve those problems is by using carbon materials as cathode component together with sulfur to form Carbon-sulfur composite cathodes. Carbon materials could improve the electrochemical performance of LiS battery due to the electrical conductivity and highly porous structure. Biomass derived conductive carbon materials have attracted increasing attention on account of their abundance, sustainability, and easy accessibility.

In this work, the thermoelectric transport properties of n-type polycrystalline SnSe were investigated with an emphasis on the out-of-plane transport through producing textural microstructure.

The structural, magnetic, and magnetoelectric properties of LaYFe<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>6</jats:sub>, prepared by the sol-gel auto-combustion method and sintered at various temperatures, have been studied. The x-ray powder diffraction study suggests the double perovskite structure with symmetries P2<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>nm (∼90%) and Pbnm (∼10%). The alternate ordering of La and Y ions is confirmed by the neutron powder diffraction (ND) study, which also suggests the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of spins. AFM behavior is also manifested by the magnetic field-dependent magnetization (M) measurement. A higher P2<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>nm phase content is desirable in the context of magnetoelectricity. Magnetic transition (∼700 K) is asserted in the temperature-dependent M measurement. The isothermal magnetization study shows weak ferromagnetism probably due to gradually increasing spin canting with temperature until the transition temperature. The highest CME coefficient (∼2.26 mOe cm/V) as well as DME coefficient (∼0.45 mV/cm Oe) in this material are recorded. True magnetoelectricity for temperature as high as 400 K opens up a new avenue on the playground of magnetoelectric (ME)-based applications. </jats:p>"

Electrochemical studies indicated that the (NiCo)–S@rGO/oxdCNT cells forming the cathode exhibited a maximum capacity of 1154.96 mAhg−1 with the initial discharge at 0.1 C. The smaller size of the CZSQDs (~10 nm) had a positive effect on the CZSQDs@(NiCo)–S@rGO/oxdCNT composites in that they had a higher initial discharge capacity of 1344.18 mAhg−1 at 0.1 C with the Coulombic efficiency being maintained at almost 97.62% during cycling.

Bulk metallic systems usually do not exhibit any magneto-electric effect. Here, we report that the magnetic properties of micron-scale ferromagnetic metals can be modulated substantially through electrochemically-controlled insertion and extraction of hydrogen atoms in metal structure. By applying voltages of only ~ 1 V, we show that the coercivity of micrometer-sized SmCo<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>, as a bulk model material, can be reversibly adjusted by ~ 1 T, two orders of magnitudes larger than previously reported.

In this work, we investigated the effect of introducing chemical disorder through heavy element substitution on the thermal conductivity of Al-Cu-Fe QC. We substituted Au and Pt elements for Cu up to 3 at% in a composition of Al63Cu25Fe12, i.e., Al63Cu25−x(Au,Pt)xFe12 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3). The substitutions of Au and Pt for Cu reduced the phonon thermal conductivity at 300 K (κph,300K) by up to 17%. The reduction of κph,300K is attributed to a decrease in the specific heat and phonon relaxation time through heavy element substitution. We found that increasing the Pt content reduced the specific heat at high temperatures, which may be caused by the locked state of phasons. The observed glass-like low values of κph,300K (0.9–1.1 W m−1 K−1 at 300 K) for Al63Cu25−x(Au,Pt)xFe12 are close to the lower limit calculated using the Cahill model.</jats:p>"

Among them NdFeB magnets are the most employed, with NdFeB having higher remanence, high coercivity and energy product. Nevertheless,their poor corrosion resistance makes them susceptible to degradation of the magnetic properties. One possible solution is the development of innovative polymeric composite magnetic materials. The preparation of NdFeB powders filled polymeric matrix (PEEK), with a double goal of protecting the magnetic alloy is proposed, thus preventing it from corrosion, and to realize a new material that can be shaped in the form of filaments. This material was used as feedstock in the 3D printing process to produce high performance magnets with customized and optimized design. The PEEK-NdFeB filaments were produced with three percentages of filler amount(i.e. 25, 50 and 75 wt%). PEEK neat filaments were produced as reference. The influence of the filler on the main thermomechanical properties of the resulting composites, as well as its effect onthe 3D printing process were evaluated by means of different investigation techniques (DSC, DMTA, XRD, tensile testing).

44690,Semiconductive ZnO has shown to be a fascinating element for application in high-performance sensors. ZnO with various thicknesses (87-500 nm) was deposited on the surface of Co-based amorphous micro-wire (Co68.15Fe4.35Si12.5B15) using magnetron sputtering technique and the magnetoimpedance (MI) response was evaluated. The MI% increases monotonously up to the 240 nm thickness of the ZnO layer. By further increase in the ZnO layer thickness the MI% decreases. MI response and field sensitivity increased from 227% and 1.7 %/Oe for bare micro-wire up to 406% and 4.99 %/Oe for ZnO deposited micro-wire with a thickness of 240 nm. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the structural grown ZnO layers. Vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) was used to reveal the role of the ZnO thin layer in the MI response. The same trend of increase and decrease in the MI% by thickness was observed for the transverse permeability of the samples determined by VSM. The obtained results address a simple way to achieve high MI response and sensitivity with selective surface sensing.

44701,"<jats:p>Rechargeable lithium–sulfur batteries (LSBs) are emerging as some of the most promising next-generation battery alternatives to state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) due to their high gravimetric energy density, being inexpensive, and having an abundance of elemental sulfur (S8). However, one main, well-known drawback of LSBs is the so-called polysulfide shuttling, where the polysulfide dissolves into organic electrolytes from sulfur host materials. Numerous studies have shown the ability of porous carbon as a sulfur host material. Porous carbon can significantly impede polysulfide shuttling and mitigate the insulating passivation layers, such as Li2S, owing to its intrinsic high electrical conductivity. This work suggests a scalable and straightforward one-step synthesis method to prepare a unique interconnected microporous and mesoporous carbon framework via salt templating with a eutectic mixture of LiI and KI at 800 °C in an inert atmosphere. The synthesis step used environmentally friendly water as a washing solvent to remove salt from the carbon–salt mixture. When employed as a sulfur host material, the electrode exhibited an excellent capacity of 780 mAh g−1 at 500 mA g−1 and a sulfur loading mass of 2 mg cm−2 with a minor capacity loss of 0.36% per cycle for 100 cycles. This synthesis method of a unique porous carbon structure could provide a new avenue for the development of an electrode with a high retention capacity and high accommodated sulfur for electrochemical energy storage applications.</jats:p>"

However, the insulating properties of sulfur and the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) seriously hinder the practical application of Li–S batteries. In this paper, a novel porous organic polymer (HUT3) was prepared based on the polycondensation between melamine and 1,4-phenylene diisocyanate. The micro morphology of HUT3 was improved by <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> growth on different mass fractions of rGO (5%, 10%, 15%), and the obtained HUT3-rGO composites were employed as sulfur carriers in Li–S batteries with promoted the sulfur loading ratio and lithium-ion mobility. Attributed to the synergistic effect of the chemisorption of polar groups and the physical constraints of HUT3 structure, HUT3-rGO/S electrodes exhibits excellent capacity and cyclability performance. For instance, HUT3-10rGO/S electrode exhibits a high initial specific capacity of 950 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> at 0.2 C and retains a high capacity of 707 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> after 500 cycles at 1 C.

However, complicated sulfur redox reactions and polysulfide shuttling significantly postpone the applications of lithium–sulfur batteries with rapid capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, a unique strategy of polysulfide electrocatalysis is proposed to improve the kinetics of the sulfur species and inhibit polysulfide shuttling in working lithium–sulfur batteries. Inspired by a natural biocatalyst and congener oxygen electrocatalysis, porphyrin was selected as the electrocatalytic active site, and framework porphyrin (POF) electrocatalysts were rationally designed, precisely fabricated, and demonstrated superior full-scheme electrocatalytic performance with regard to improving the kinetics for polysulfide conversion, Li 2S nucleation, and dissolution of Li 2S to polysulfides, simultaneously. Consequently, the lithium–sulfur batteries with POF electrocatalysts achieve high capacity of 1611 mAh·g −1 at 0.1 C; outstanding stability with the capacity decay rate of 0.071% in 400 cycles, and satisfied performance with a high sulfur loading up to 4.3 mg·cm −2.

Such materials are of interest for structural applications; however, structural polymers with high melting temperatures pose the challenge of generating high localised temperatures enabling self-healing. A method to prepare a multiferroic-Polyamide 6 (PA6) nanocomposite with tuneable magnetocaloric properties is reported. Tunability arises from varying the MNP material (and any coating, its dispersion, and agglomerate sizes in the nanocomposite). The superparamagnetic MNPs (SMNPs) and iron oxide MNPs with and without surface functionalization were dispersed into PA6 through in situ polymerization, and their magnetic properties were compared. Furthermore, computer simulations were used to quantify the dispersion state of MNPs and assess the influence of the interaction radius on the magnetic response of the self-healable magnetic nanoparticle polymer (SHMNP) composite. It was shown that maintaining the low interaction radius through the dispersion of the low coercivity MNPs could allow tuning of the bulk magnetocaloric properties of the resulting mesostructures. An in-situ polymerization method improved the dispersion and reduced the maximum interaction radius value from ca. 806 to 371 nm and increased the magnetic response for the silica-coated SMNP composite.

The thickness independence of MA was obtained by observing a series of hysteresis loops and magnetic domains. The MA is proved subtly to be related to the variation of orbital magnetic moment acquired by ferromagnetic resonance.

However, the intermediate charge–discharge product dissolves easily into the electrolyte to produce a shuttle effect, which is a key factor limiting the rapid development of Li-S batteries. Among the various materials used to solve the challenges related to pure sulfur cathodes, biomass derived carbon materials are getting wider research attention. In this work, we report on the fabrication of cathode materials for Li-S batteries based on composites of sulfur and biomass-derived porous ramie carbon (RC), which are coated with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). RC can not only adsorb polysulfide in its pores, but also provide conductive channels. At the same time, the MWCNTs coating further reduces the dissolution of polysulfides into the electrolyte and weakens the shuttle effect. The sulfur loading rate of RC is 66.3 wt.%. As a result, the initial discharge capacity of the battery is 1325.6 mAh·g−1 at 0.1 C long cycle, and it can still maintain 812.5 mAh·g−1 after 500 cycles.

The Ni1-xTbxFe2O4 composition was synthesized and x was selected as 0.025, 0.050 and 0.070, respectively. The single phase Ni ferrite was produced after sintering at 1250 °C for 4 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were performed for the structural analysis. The results of the structural analysis indicated that second phase did not form in Ni1-xTbxFe2O4. Additionally, the polyaniline-terbium doped NiFe2O4 composites were produced by hot pressing using the compositions of Ni0.975Tb0.025Fe2O4.018, Ni0.950Tb0.050Fe2O4.037, Ni0.93Tb0.070Fe2O4.0525 and aniline. The weight ratios of terbium-doped nickel ferrite and aniline were 1:1 and 1:3 respectively and epoxy resin was used to produce microwave absorbing composites. The magnetic properties of fabricated composites were investigated using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The microwave absorbing performances of Polyaniline-NiFe2O4: Terbium composites were investigated by reflectivity in 0 – 8 GHz using two–port vector network analyzer. A minimum of  – 39.41 dB reflection performance was obtained in 7.9 GHz at the thickness of 2.0 mm. This reflection performance can be modulated simply by controlling the content of polyaniline in the samples for the required frequency bands.

Two characteristics frequency bands were observed in the range of 400cm-1 to 550 cm-1 which showed successful formation of spinel structure. It is also the evidence of metal-oxygen bonding at octahedral and tetrahedral sites in spinel ferrites. Also, bands for carbon-hydrogen, carboxyl group, carbon-oxygen stretching and iron-cobalt alloys were observed in the FTIR spectra. By using these values of characteristics frequencies, octahedral and tetrahedral radii were calculated and found in decreasing trend with increasing concentration.

After the potential window was optimized for the electropolymerization process, a fixed potential was found to generate a CMPTCBz with minimal overoxidation and a high BET surface area. The CMPTCBz was mixed with sulfur and used in the optimized preparation of CMPTCBz-S cathodes. Coin cells were assembled with lithium metal used as the anode and electrochemically evaluated. Results showed that the CMPTCBz-S cathodes with different sulfur loadings have excellent charge/discharge cycling performance with initial discharge capacities ranging from 800 to 1400 mAh·g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>S and a capacity retention greater than 80% after 100 cycles. This is due to both the enhanced electrical conductivity of the cathode and physical confinement of the generated lithium-polysulfides inside the pores of the CMPTCBz.

45133,"<jats:p>Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are deemed to be one of the most optimal solutions for the next generation of high-energy-density and low-cost energy storage systems. However, the low volumetric energy density and short cycle life are a bottleneck for their commercial application. To achieve high energy density for lithium-sulfur batteries, the concept of synergistic adsorptive–catalytic sites is proposed. Base on this concept, the TiN@C/S/Ta2O5 sulfur electrode with about 90 wt% sulfur content is prepared. TiN contributes its high intrinsic electron conductivity to improve the redox reaction of polysulfides, while Ta2O5 provides strong adsorption capability toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Moreover, the multidimensional carbon structure facilitates the infiltration of electrolytes and the motion of ions and electrons throughout the framework. As a result, the coin Li-S cells with TiN@C/S/Ta2O5 cathode exhibit superior cycle stability with a decent capacity retention of 56.1% over 300 cycles and low capacity fading rate of 0.192% per cycle at 0.5 C. Furthermore, the pouch cells at sulfur loading of 5.3 mg cm−2 deliver a high areal capacity of 5.8 mAh cm−2 at low electrolyte/sulfur ratio (E/S, 3.3 μL mg−1), implying a high sulfur utilization even under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.</jats:p>"

45144,"Multiferroics is a class of functional materials that simultaneously exhibit ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in a single structure. We report here the integration of anti-ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism in a new M-type hexaferrite compound, in which 0.3 Sr ions was substituted by 0.2 La3+ ions in SrFe12O19 so as to keep the charge balance. This doped compound is expressed as a molecular formula of La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19, which was confirmed by XRD to have the same structure as SrFe12O19 with a lattice contraction of 0.59%. Surprisingly, the doping effect turns La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 from ferroelectric to antiferroelectric phase, which displays double hysteresis loops with a maximum polarization of 154 uC/cm2 and a remnant one of 38uC/cm2. The dielectric constant is also greatly improved from 1462 to 1451778 at 10.2Hz by this substitution. This compound simultaneously demonstrates strong ferromagnetism, the remnant magnetic moment and coercive field are 52 emu/g and 5876 Oe, respectively. In addition, La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 also exhibits strong magnetodielectric (MD) response, in which a applying magnetic field B lifts the whole e1-f spectra up and right shifts e2-f spectra to higher frequency side. Both real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant varies with frequency and B field and obey Debye relaxation model. The maximum MD increment in e1 reaches as high as 540830 upon a B field of 926mT. The capacitance of the La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 ceramics could be much more enhanced by applying a magnetic field B, which could induce an additional polarization P(H) upon the conventional P(E) by the cycloid conical spin in the intermediate phases. These results suggest that La0.2Sr0.7Fe12O19 exhibits a strong interplay between magnetic ordering and ferroelectricity, which makes it a good magnetoelectric coupling candidate."

45169,"<jats:p>The practical application of quasicrystals (QCs) as thermoelectric materials makes icosahedral (i-) Al–Pd–Re QC attractive because of its moderate electrical conductivity (~280 Ω−1 cm−1), relatively high Seebeck coefficient (~100 μV K−1), and low thermal conductivity (~1.3 W m−1 K−1) at room temperature. To develop a thermoelectric Π-shaped power generation module, we need both p- and n-type thermoelectric materials. In this work, we aimed to develop an n-type i-Al–Pd–Re-based QC and investigated the effect of Co substitution for Re on the thermoelectric properties, i.e., the electron-doping effect. We synthesized dense bulk samples with nominal compositions of Al71Pd20(Re1−xCox)9 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) via arc-melting, annealing, and sintering methods. We found that Co can produce n-type carriers in dilute substitution amounts of x = 0.1 and 0.2; however, the Seebeck coefficient at 300 K showed an n- to p-type transition with increasing x. This indicates that a simple rigid-band approximation is not applicable for i-Al–Pd–Re QC, which makes it difficult to synthesize an n-type i-Al–Pd–Re-based QC. Although the thermal conductivity was reduced from 1.28 (x = 0) to 1.08 W m−1 K−1 (x = 0.3) at 373 K by lowering of the electron thermal conductivity (electrical conductivity) and the alloying effect via Co substitution, the dimensionless figure of merit was not enhanced because of lowering of the power factor for all samples. The elastic moduli of i-Al–Pd–Re QC decreased by Co substitution, indicating that i-Al–Pd–Re-Co QC had a more ionic and brittle character.</jats:p>"

MGC is prepared via a reactive templating approach, wherein the organic MCA crystals are utilized as the pore-/micro-structure-directing agent and nitrogen source. The homogeneous coating of spherical MCA crystal particles with glucose followed by carbonization at 600 °C leads to the formation of hierarchical porous hollow carbon spheres with abundant pyridinic N-functional groups without losing their microstructural ordering. Moreover, MGC enables facile penetration and intensive anchoring of LiPS, especially under high loading sulfur conditions. Consequently, the MGC cathode exhibited a high areal capacity of 5.79 mAh cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and high loading sulfur of 6.0 mg cm−2 with a minor capacity decay rate of 0.18% per cycle for 100 cycles.</jats:p>"

However, obtaining pure single-phase BiFeO3 ceramic with a low electrical conductivity via solid-state reactions remains a problem that limits its application. In this work, the suppression of secondary phases in BiFeO3 was studied by varying the compositional parameters and the sintering temperature. The addition of 1% Bi2O3 to the stoichiometric precursor mixture prevented the formation of secondary phases observed when sintering stoichiometric precursors. The pure phase ceramic had a p-type conductivity and a three-decade lower electrical conductivity as measured by impedance spectroscopy. Annealing of optimally synthesized material at different partial pressures of oxygen in an oxygen–nitrogen gas atmosphere showed that the reason for this type of conductivity lies in the high concentration of defects associated with oxygen. By annealing in various mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen, it is possible to control the concentration of these defects and hence the conductivity, which can go down another two decades.

However, in order to ensure good life-time stability of PCFCs, it is necessary to ensure rational chemical design in functional materials. Within the present work, we propose new Ni-based perovskite phases of PrNi0.4M0.6O3–δ (where M = Co, Fe) for potential utilization in protonic ceramic electrochemical cells. Along with their successful synthesis, functional properties of the PrNi0.4M0.6O3–δ materials, such as chemical compatibility with a number of oxygen-ionic and proton-conducting electrolytes, thermal expansion behavior, electrical conductivity, and electrochemical behavior, were comprehensively studied. According to the obtained data, the Co-containing nickelate exhibits excellent conductivity and polarization behavior; on the other hand, it demonstrates a high reactivity with all studied electrolytes along with elevated thermal expansion coefficients. Conversely, while the iron-based nickelate had superior chemical and thermal compatibility, its transport characteristics were 2–5 times worse. Although, PrNi0.4Co0.6O3–δ and PrNi0.4Fe0.6O3–δ represent some disadvantages, this work provides a promising pathway for further improvement of Ni-based perovskite electrodes.</jats:p>"

LaNi0.6Co0.4−xFexO3 (x = 0–0.3) perovskite-type oxides were investigated in this work.

Detailed phase evolution studies using XRD and SEM/EDS demonstrated that firing at temperatures as high as 1200 °C is required to eliminate undesirable secondary phases. Under such conditions, nickel tends to segregate as a metallic phase and is unlikely to incorporate into the perovskite lattice. Ceramic samples sintered at 1500 °C exhibited temperature-activated electrical conductivity that showed a weak p(O2) dependence and increased with vanadium content, reaching a maximum of ~17 S/cm at 1000 °C. STVN ceramics showed moderate thermal expansion coefficients (12.5–14.3 ppm/K at 25–1100 °C) compatible with that of yttria-stabilized zirconia (8YSZ). Porous STVN electrodes on 8YSZ solid electrolytes were fabricated at 1100 °C and studied using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy at 700–900 °C in an atmosphere of diluted humidified H2 under zero DC conditions. As-prepared STVN electrodes demonstrated comparatively poor electrochemical performance, which was attributed to insufficient intrinsic electrocatalytic activity and agglomeration of metallic nickel during the high-temperature synthetic procedure. Incorporation of an oxygen-ion-conducting Ce0.9Gd0.1O2-δ phase (20–30 wt.%) and nano-sized Ni as electrocatalyst (≥1 wt.%) into the porous electrode structure via infiltration resulted in a substantial improvement in electrochemical activity and reduction of electrode polarization resistance by 6–8 times at 900 °C and ≥ one order of magnitude at 800 °C.</jats:p>"

In this work, we report the dielectric, ferroelectric, and structural phase transitions behavior in the KBNNO compound using dielectric, X-ray diffraction, and Raman studies at ambient and as a function of temperature. Analyses of X-ray diffraction (XRD) data at room temperature (rtp) revealed the orthorhombic phase (sp. Gr. Amm2) of the compound with a minor secondary NiO cubic phase (sp. Gr. Fm3m). A direct optical band gap Eg of 1.66 eV was estimated at rtp from the UV–Vis reflectance spectrum analysis. Observation of non-saturated electric polarization loops were attributed to leakage current effects pertaining to oxygen vacancies in the compound. Magnetization studies showed ferromagnetism at room temperature (300 K) in this material. XRD studies on KBNNO at elevated temperatures revealed orthorhombic-to-tetragonal and tetragonal-to-cubic phase transitions at 523 and 713 K, respectively. Temperature-dependent dielectric response, being leaky, did not reveal any phase transition. Electrical conductivity data as a function of temperature obeyed Jonscher power law and satisfied the correlated barrier-hopping model, indicating dominance of the hopping conduction mechanism. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies over a wide range of temperature (82–673 K) inferred the rhombohedral-to-orthorhombic and orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transitions at ~260, and 533 K, respectively.

Herein, we demonstrate an alternative approach based on the formation of multiphase composites, at which the individual components have distinctions in the electric and thermal conductivities. The proof-of-concept includes the formation of multiphase composites between well-defined thermoelectric Co-based oxides: Ni, Fe co-substituted perovskite, LaCo0.8Ni0.1Fe0.1O3 (LCO), and misfit layered Ca3Co4O9. The interfacial chemical and electrical properties of composites are probed with the means of SEM, PEEM/XAS, and XPS tools, as well as the magnetic susceptibility measurements. The thermoelectric power of the multiphase composites is evaluated by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, calculated from the independently measured electrical resistivity (ρ), Seebeck coefficient (S), and thermal conductivity (λ). It has been demonstrated that the magnitude’s electric and thermal conductivities depend more significantly on the composite interfaces than the Seebeck coefficient values. As a result, the highest thermoelectric activity is observed at the composite richer on the perovskite (i.e., ZT = 0.34 at 298 K).</jats:p>"

The BSFCux (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) crystallized in a cubic perovskite structure (Pm3¯m). By thermogravimetric analysis and surface chemical analysis, it was confirmed that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the lattice increased with Cu doping. The average oxidation state of B-site ions decreased from 3.583 (x = 0) to 3.210 (x = 0.15), and the valence band maximum shifted from −0.133 eV (x = 0) to −0.222 eV (x = 0.15). The electrical conductivity of BSFCux increased with temperature because of the thermally activated small polaron hopping mechanism showing a maximum value of 64.12 S cm−1 (x = 0.15) at 500 °C. The ASR value as an indicator of ORR activity decreased by 72.6% from 0.135 Ω cm2 (x = 0) to 0.037 Ω cm2 (x = 0.15) at 700 °C.

            , is reported. Structure analysis indicates that the crystal structure of film is monoclinic in contrast to bulk, which is rhombohedral. The films display a room-temperature spontaneous polarization (50 to 60 microcoulombs per square centimeter) almost an order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk (6.1 microcoulombs per square centimeter). The observed enhancement is corroborated by first-principles calculations and found to originate from a high sensitivity of the polarization to small changes in lattice parameters. The films also exhibit enhanced thickness-dependent magnetism compared with the bulk. These enhanced and combined functional responses in thin film form present an opportunity to create and implement thin film devices that actively couple the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters.

45734,"<jats:p> Composite lithium metal anodes with three-dimensional (3D) conductive fabric present great potential to be used in high-energy-density flexible batteries for next-generation wearable electronics. However, lithium dendrites at the top of the fabric anode increase the risk of separator piercing and, therefore, cause a high possibility of short circuits, especially when undergoing large mechanical deformation. To ensure the safe application of the flexible lithium metal batteries, we herein propose a 3D Janus current collector by a simple modification of the bottom side of carbon fabric (CF) with a lithiophilic Au layer to construct highly flexible, stable, and safe Li metal anodes. The Janus Au layer can guide an orientated deposition of Li to the bottom of the CF. The lithium dendrite problem can be largely alleviated due to the lithium-free interface between the anode and separator, and meanwhile, the porous upper skeleton of the CF also provides large space to buffer the volume expansion of lithium metal. The resulting composite lithium metal anode exhibits a significant improvement in the life cycle (∼two fold) compared to the traditional top deposition of lithium metal. More importantly, assembled full batteries using the Janus anode structure exhibit high stability and safety during severe mechanical deformation, indicating the opportunity of the orientated deposition strategy to be used in future flexible and wearable electronics. </jats:p>"

45763,"Layered van der Waals (vdW) magnets are prominent playgrounds for developing magnetoelectric, magneto-optic and spintronic devices. In spintronics, particularly in spincaloritronic applications, low thermal conductivity ($κ$) is highly desired. Here, by combining thermal transport measurements with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate low $κ$ down to 1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ in a typical vdW ferromagnet Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$. In the paramagnetic state, development of magnetic fluctuations way above $T_\mathrm{c}=$ 33 K strongly reduces $κ$ via spin-phonon scattering, leading to low $κ\sim$ 1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ over a wide temperature range, in comparable to that of amorphous silica. In the magnetically ordered state, emergence of resonant magnon-phonon scattering limits $κ$ below $\sim$ 2 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, which would be three times larger if magnetic scatterings were absent. Application of magnetic fields strongly suppresses the spin-phonon scattering, giving rise to large enhancements of $κ$. Our calculations well capture these complex behaviours of $κ$ by taking the temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent spin-phonon scattering into account. Realization of low $κ$ which is easily tunable by magnetic fields in Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, may further promote spincaloritronic applications of vdW magnets. Our theoretical approach may also provide a generic understanding of spin-phonon scattering, which appears to play important roles in various systems."

Moreover, Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N with high ionic conductivity formed at grain boundaries and interface can also improve Li-ion transport kinetics.

Both physical morphology confinement and chemical adsorption/diffusion regulation are two crucial approaches to designing lithiophilic materials to alleviate dendrite of Li metal anode. However, their roles in suppressing dendrite growth for long-life Li anode are not fully understood yet. Herein, three different Ni-based nanosheet arrays (NiO-NS, Ni<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N-NS, and Ni<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>P<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>-NS) on carbon cloth as proof-of-concept lithiophilic frameworks are proposed for Li metal anodes. The two-dimensional nanoarray is more promising to facilitate uniform Li<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> flow and electric field.

Anode-free lithium metal cells are particularly attractive as they facilitate the highest energy density cell architecture. In this work, we investigate the performance of anode-free cells cycled under different protocols. We demonstrate the impact of charge and discharge current density with three different cycling conditions: a symmetric charge-discharge, an asymmetric faster charge and an asymmetric slower charge. We show that the relative rate of charge vs discharge is more important than the absolute current densities, and that cycling with an asymmetric slower charge protocol is optimal in agreement with previous studies on cells with lithium metal anodes. We also examine the effect of depth of discharge and demonstrate how the lower voltage cut-off can be chosen to form a lithium reservoir in situ. We show that the capacity of the lithium reservoir significantly benefits lifetime for cells cycled with a limited depth of discharge. Finally, we develop a specialized intermittent high depth of discharge cycling protocol optimized for anode-free lithium metal cells.</jats:p>"

The increased risk of plating has been attributed to transport limitations, and architectured electrodes may reduce plating risk. However, while theoretical studies have shown that reaction non-uniformity arises due to interplay of transport limitations, anode open circuit voltage behavior and reaction kinetics, its effect on lithium plating has not been studied. We use analytic and numerical simulations to predict onset of plating in graphite anode half-cells at high C-rates and demonstrate how anodes with layered porosities can delay plating. Simplified analytical models identify trends for plating onset and predictions are calibrated against numerical models. A calibrated numerical model of graphite demonstrates qualitative agreement with analytical model predictions. This reaction inhomogeneity mechanism occurs in the absence of lithium ion depletion, indicating that these mechanisms may contribute to capacity loss independently or simultaneously. A bilayer model of graphite exhibits delayed plating onset, and an optimization procedure is presented.

46423,"<jats:p>Research on the magnetocaloric effect and its application for cooling near room temperature over the past few years has helped to move this phenomenon from a scientific curiosity to an emerging technology. Two of the most important advances include the demonstration which proved that it is possible to obtain significant cooling powers (600 W) at high Carnot efficiencies (60%) and with a large coefficient of performance (15) near room temperature in moderately strong magnetic fields (⩽5 T); and the discovery of the giant magnetocaloric effect in the Gd5(SixGe1−x)4 series of alloys. Also, new knowledge about the magnetocaloric effect has been gained. This includes: the relationship between the nature of the magnetic transformation(s) and the temperature dependence of the magnetocaloric effect, the entropy utilized in the magnetocaloric process, and the role of impurities on the giant magnetocaloric effect.</jats:p>"

For the temperature range between ∼50 and ∼280 K it exceeds the reversible (with respect to alternating magnetic field) ΔSmag for any known magnetic refrigerant material at the corresponding Curie temperature by a factor of 2–10. The two most striking features of this alloy system are: (1) the first order phase transformation, which brings about the large ΔSmag in Gd5(SixGe1−x)4, is reversible with respect to alternating magnetic field, i.e., the giant magnetocaloric effect can be utilized in an active magnetic regenerator magnetic refrigerator; and (2) the ordering temperature is tunable from ∼30 to ∼276 K by adjusting the Si:Ge ratio without losing the giant magnetic entropy change.</jats:p>"

Besides, the sharp drop of resistivity at the insulator–metal transition associated with the magnetic transition gives rise to a large temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR). For the La0.7Ca0.3MnO3 and La2/3(Ca,Pb)1/3MnO3 single crystal, the peak of TCR is ∼50%/K at 218 K and ∼10%/K at 290 K, respectively.</jats:p>"
46429,"<jats:p>Colossal magnetoresistance with more than a thousandfold change in resistivity (ΔR/RH=127 000% at 77 K, H=6 T) has been obtained in epitaxially grown La-Ca-Mn-O thin films. This magnetoresistance value is about three orders of magnitude higher than is typically seen in the giant-magnetoresistance-type metallic, superlattice films. The temperature of peak magnetoresistance is located in the region of metallic resistivity behavior. As the magnetoresistance peak occurs not at the temperature of magnetic transition but at a temperature where the magnetization is still substantial, the spin-disorder scattering is not likely to be the main mechanism in these highly magnetoresistive films. The peak can be shifted to near room temperature by adjusting processing parameters. Near-room-temperature ΔR/RH values of ∼1300% at 260 K and ∼400% at 280 K have been observed. The presence of grain boundaries appears to be very detrimental to achieving large magnetoresistance in the lanthanum manganite compounds. The fact that the electrical resistivity of a material can be manipulated by magnetic field to change by orders of magnitude could be useful for various device applications.</jats:p>"

The introduction of Al at Mo positions produced conspicuous amounts of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite, detected by neutrons. This is essential to induce ionic diffusion, providing a mixed ionic and electronic conduction (MIEC), since in MIEC electrodes, charge carriers are combined in one single phase and the ionic conductivity can be one order of magnitude higher than in a conventional material. The thermal expansion coefficients of the reduced and oxidized samples demonstrated that these materials perfectly match with the La0.8Sr0.2Ga0.83Mg0.17O3−δ electrolyte, La0.4Ce0.6O2−δ buffer layer and other components of the cell. Scanning electron microscopy after the test in a real solid oxide fuel cell showed a very dense electrolyte and porous electrodes, essential requirements for this type of fuel. SrMo1−xAlxO3−δ perovskites are, thus, a good replacement of conventional biphasic cermet anodes in solid oxide fuel cells.</jats:p>"

46731,"<jats:p>Bain La1-xBaxScO3-δ impairs sintering and leads to a decrease in its ceramic density. Two approaches have been studied for obtaining dense ceramics: using a high processing temperature and the introduction of a Co3O4 sintering additive. An addition of only 0.5 wt% of Co3O4 sintering additive, despite the positive sintering effect, causes a noticeable violation of stoichiometry, with partial decomposition of the material. This can lead to the formation of cationic vacancies, which form associates with oxygen vacancies and significantly reduce the oxygen ion and proton conductivity of the materials. There is also a partial substitution of Co for Sc in La1-xBaxScO3-δ, which reduces the stability of protons: it reduces the enthalpy of the hydration reaction, but increases the mobility of protons. Thus, the Co3O4 sintering additive causes a complex of negative effects on the conductivity of La1-xBaxScO3-δ materials. Only high-temperature (1800 °C) processing with protection against Ba loss contributes to the production of dense La1-xBaxScO3-δ ceramics. The chemical composition of such ceramics corresponds well to the specified one, which ensures high water uptake and, consequently, high proton conductivity.</jats:p>"

However, Mg anodes suffer from surface passivation film in most glyme-based conventional electrolytes, leading to irreversible plating/stripping behavior of Mg. Here we report a facile and safe method to obtain a modified Mg metal anode with a Sn-based artificial layer via ion-exchange and alloying reactions. In the artificial coating layer, Mg2Sn alloy composites offer a channel for fast ion transport and insulating MgCl2/SnCl2 bestows the necessary potential gradient to prevent deposition on the surface. Significant improved ion conductivity of the solid electrolyte interfaces and decreased overpotential of Mg symmetric cells in Mg(TFSI)2/DME electrolyte are obtained.

After the cyclic EPD in six stages, the resulting BCGCuO film (6 μm) (1) on the LNO substrate was completely dense, but the scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed the absence of barium in the film caused by its intensive diffusion into the substrate and evaporation during the sintering. The BCO layer prevented the barium loss in the BCGCuO film (2); however, the protective film possessed a porous island structure, which resulted in the deterioration of the film’s conductivity. The use of the modified LBNO cathode also effectively prevented the loss of barium in the BCGCuO film (3). A BCGCuO film whose conductivity behavior most closely resembled that of the compacts was obtained by using this method which has strong potential for practical applications in solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology.</jats:p>"

Single-phase solid solutions were obtained in the case of calcium content x = 0.03 and 0.05, whereas a calcium-enriched impurity phase was found at x = 0.10. Water uptake and release were studied by means of thermogravimetric analysis, thermodesorption spectroscopy and dilatometry. It was shown that lower calcium content in the main phase leads to a decrease in the water uptake. Conductivity was measured by four-probe direct current (DC) and two-probe ascension current (AC) methods at different temperatures, pO2 and pH2O. The effects of phase composition, microstructure and defect structure on electrical conductivity, as well as correlation between conductivity and water uptake experiments, were discussed. The contribution of ionic conductivity of La1−xCaxScO3−α rises with decreasing temperature and increasing humidity. The domination of proton conductivity at temperatures below 500 °C under oxidizing and reducing atmospheres is exhibited. Water uptake and release as well as transport properties of La1−xCaxScO3−α are compared with the properties of similar proton electrolytes, La1−xSrxScO3−α, and the possible reasons for their differences were discussed.</jats:p>"

               <jats:p>Experiments investigating magnetic-field-tuned superconductor–insulator transition (HSIT) mostly focus on two-dimensional material systems where the transition and its proximate ground-state phases, often exhibit features that are seemingly at odds with the expected behavior. Here we present a complementary study of a three-dimensional pressure-packed amorphous indium-oxide (InOx) powder where granularity controls the HSIT. Above a low threshold pressure of ∼0.2 GPa, vestiges of superconductivity are detected, although neither a true superconducting transition nor insulating behavior are observed. Instead, a saturation at very high resistivity at low pressure is followed by saturation at very low resistivity at higher pressure. We identify both as different manifestations of anomalous metallic phases dominated by superconducting fluctuations. By analogy with previous identification of the low resistance saturation as a ‘failed superconductor’, our data suggests that the very high resistance saturation is a manifestation of a ‘failed insulator’. Above a threshold pressure of ∼6 GPa, the sample becomes fully packed, and superconductivity is robust, with <jats:italic>T</jats:italic>

46883,"<jats:p>Significant resistivity variations have previously been observed in oxides subjected to relatively low ion irradiation doses, nominally insufficient to generate the amount of bulk defects needed to explain the phenomena. In an effort to unveil the underlying mechanisms, we performed a systematic comparative study of the resistivity evolution in In2O3-based oxides as a function of low ion doses and ultraviolet (UV) illumination, observing striking correlations. Specifically, we found that irradiation with ∼3 × 1012 Si/cm2 and ∼18 h UV exposure result in similar resistivity drops, interpreted in terms of irradiation/illumination assisted desorption of oxygen containing species from the surface. This was further proven by post-irradiation exposure of one of the samples to an oxygen atmosphere partially restoring the resistivity. Combining the present results with literature data, we conclude that the radiation tolerance of In2O3-based and similar oxides depends on the surface charge modifications, individual defect contributions, and contributions from defect complexes at low, intermediate, and high doses, respectively.</jats:p>"

An extremely high resistivity is observed in the new system Ce1−xSrxMnO3 (CSMO) which becomes insulating below its Curie temperature of 43 K. A maximum magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of 40% for CSMO and 53% for LCMO is observed. A larger change in resistivity is seen to correspond to an increase in the Ce concentration, however this is offset by an overall resistivity increase which keeps the MR ratio low. The high resistivity may be due to unreacted oxides in the samples. If true, the amount of impurity appears to be proportional to the Ce doping.

However, lack of mechanistic study of sulfur reaction in the Mg cation environment has severely hindered our understanding and prevents effective measures for performance improvement. In this work, the very first systematic fundamental study on Mg/S system is conducted by combining experimental methods with computational approach. The thermodynamics and reaction pathway of sulfur cathode in MgTFSI<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>–DME electrolyte, as well as the associated kinetics are thoroughly investigated. The results here reveal that sulfur undergoes a consecutive staging pathway in which the formation and chain‐shortening of polysulfide occur at early stage accompanied by the dissolution of long‐chain polysulfide, and solid‐state transition from short‐chain polysulfide to magnesium sulfide occurs at late stage. The former process is much faster than the latter due to the synergetic effect of the mediating effect of dissolved polysulfide and the fast diffusion of Mg ion in the amorphous intermediate.</jats:p>"

The decomposition of aqueous electrolytes is mainly facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and the water molecules in the solvation sheath. Here, three types of small dipole molecules (small molecules containing a dipole; glycerol (Gly), erythritol (Et), and acrylamide (AM)) are reported to develop aqueous electrolytes with high safety and wide ESW (over 2.5 V) for aqueous lithium‐, sodium‐, and zinc‐ion batteries, respectively. The solvation‐sheath structures are explored by ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrating that three types of dipole molecules deplete the water molecules in the solvation sheath of the charge carrier and break the hydrogen bond network between the water molecules, thus effectively expanding the ESW. A battery constructed from lithium titanate and lithium manganate in Gly‐containing electrolyte exhibits an output voltage of 2.45 V and retains a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> after 400 cycles.

Similar with other 2D materials, MXenes generally suffer severe self-agglomeration, low capacity, and unsatisfied durability, particularly for larger sodium/potassium ions, compromising their practical values. In this work, a novel ternary heterostructure self-assembled from transition metal selenides (MSe, M = Cu, Ni, and Co), MXene nanosheets and N-rich carbonaceous nanoribbons (CNRibs) with ultrafast ion transport properties is designed for sluggish sodium-ion (SIB) and potassium-ion (PIB) batteries. Benefiting from the diverse chemical characteristics, the positively charged MSe anchored onto the electronegative hydroxy (–OH) functionalized MXene surfaces through electrostatic adsorption, while the fungal-derived CNRibs bonded with the other side of MXene through amino bridging and hydrogen bonds. This unique MXene-based heterostructure prevents the restacking of 2D materials, increases the intrinsic conductivity, and most importantly, provides ultrafast interfacial ion transport pathways and extra surficial and interfacial storage sites, and thus, boosts the high-rate storage performances in SIB and PIB applications.

The new designs provide more space for the active material so that also less energetic, but more sustainable, safer and cheaper materials can be (re)considered, such as LiFePO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> which encounters a renaissance at the moment. The sodium ion battery is currently emerging as a potential alternative to the LIB. Li‐air and Li−S batteries are not ready for application in cars, yet. A potential future candidate is the solid‐state battery, which shall benefit from the use of a safe Li metal anode, delivering higher capacities and rate capabilities.</jats:p>"

Oxygen redox reactions in layered oxide cathodes are proven to contribute additionally high specific capacity, while such cathodes often suffer from irreversible structural transitions, causing serious capacity fading and voltage decay upon cycling, and the formation process of the oxidized oxygen species remains elusive.

Additionally, Al doping also induces an increased interlayer spacing and inhibits the unfavorable P2 to O2 phase transition upon desodiation/sodiation, which is common in P2‐type Mn‐based cathode materials, leading to the great improvement in capacity retention and rate capability. This work provides deeper insights into the development of structurally stable and high‐capacity layered cathode materials for SIBs with anion–cation synergetic contributions.</jats:p>"

Herein, a new approach is presented to substantially improve the electrochemical properties of PBAs by introducing high entropy into the crystal structure. To achieve this, five different metal species are introduced, sharing the same nitrogen‐coordinated site, thereby increasing the configurational entropy of the system beyond 1.5R. By careful selection of the elements, high‐entropy PBA (HE‐PBA) presents a quasi‐zero‐strain reaction mechanism, resulting in increased cycling stability and rate capability. The key to such improvement lies in the high entropy and associated effects as well as the presence of several active redox centers. The gassing behavior of PBAs is also reported. Evolution of dimeric cyanogen due to oxidation of the cyanide ligands is detected, which can be attributed to the structural degradation of HE‐PBA during battery operation.

Methods for creating conductive sublayers on non-conductive SDC substrates under EPD conditions, such as the synthesis of a conductive polypyrrole (PPy) layer and deposition of a layer of finely dispersed platinum from a suspension of its powder in isopropanol, are proposed. The kinetics of disaggregation, disperse composition, electrokinetic potential, and the effect of adding iodine to the BCSCuO suspension on these parameters as factors determining the preparation of stable suspensions and successful EPD processes are explored. Button cells based on a carrying SDC electrolyte of 550 μm in thickness with BCSCuO layers (8–35 μm) on the anode, cathode, and anode/cathode side, and Pt electrodes are electrochemically tested.

However, the specific chemical properties of water induce the problems of narrow electrochemical stability window, low stability of water–electrode interface reactions, and dissolution of electrode materials and intermediate products. Therefore, new low‐cost aqueous electrolytes with different water chemistry are required. The nature of water depends largely on its hydroxyl‐based hydrogen bonding structure. Therefore, the super‐concentrated hydroxyl‐rich sugar solutions are designed to change the original hydrogen bonding structure of water. The super‐concentrated sugars can reduce the free water molecules and destroy the tetrahedral structure, thus lowering the binding degree of water molecules by breaking the hydrogen bonds. The ionic electrolytes based on super‐concentrated sugars have the expanded electrochemical stability window (up to 2.812 V), wide temperature adaptability (–50 to 80 °C), and fair ionic conductivity (8.536 mS cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>). Aqueous lithium‐, sodium‐, potassium‐ion batteries and supercapacitors using super‐concentrated sugar‐based electrolytes demonstrate an excellent electrochemical performance.

The densities of liquid Zr–V alloys were measured over a wide temperature range from overheated to undercooled states, and the results exhibited a linear dependence on temperature for all 11 compositions. Two typical solidification pathways were observed for hypoeutectic alloys. Except for a slowing down of decreasing tendency near a eutectic Zr57V43 alloy, the liquid densities of Zr–V alloys almost decrease linearly with increasing V content. Accordingly, the thermal expansion coefficients of Zr–V alloys were also derived from containerless measurements, and they showed an increasing tendency with V content. Since thermal radiative dominated the heat transfer process, the ratio of isobaric specific heat to hemispherical emissivity was directly deduced from the thermal balance equation, leading to a quadratic relationship with temperature. It was found that the increase of V content enhanced the ability of radiative heat dissipation below 16.5 at. % V content.</jats:p>"

This database currently contains 140,000 sample entries, characterized by structural (100,000), synthetic (80,000), chemical (70,000), and optoelectronic (50,000) properties of inorganic thin film materials, grouped in &gt;4,000 sample entries across &gt;100 materials systems; more than a half of these data are publicly available. This article shows how the HTEM database may enable scientists to explore materials by browsing web-based user interface and an application programming interface. This paper also describes a HTE approach to generating materials data, and discusses the laboratory information management system (LIMS), that underpin HTEM database. Finally, this manuscript illustrates how advanced machine learning algorithms can be adopted to materials science problems using this open data resource.</jats:p>"

The grain size distribution and density or specific surface area changes were investigated in each approach while the individual parameters were changed. The evaluation of BLCF synthesis parameters enables tailoring the microstructure to various applications. It was observed that with lowering the size of milling balls and increasing the angular velocity the material will be porous and thus more appropriate as electrode material in proton ceramic fuel cell or electrolyzer. An increase of time, balls diameter, and/or angular velocity of milling enables one to densify the material in case of membrane application in, e.g., as a gas sensor.

A shift of TM by about 25 K to higher temperature was observed for an applied hydrostatic pressure of P = 6.6 kbar with respect to ambient pressure. A large drop in resistivity was observed for large Ag concentration. The magnetoresistance was dramatically suppressed due to an increase in the disorder of the system with increasing Ag concentration. Possible mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior are discussed.</jats:p>"

The structural, magnetic, and transport properties of the Zr doped compounds were determined using x-ray diffraction, dc magnetic susceptibility, and a four probe method for electrical resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements in the temperature range of 5–400 K. The structure of the compounds was found to be rhombohedral. The magnetization versus temperature curves show ferromagnetic regions with the magnetic transition temperatures getting saturated for x⩾0.07 compounds. The resistivity curves show decreasing resistivity with increasing Zr content in the compound. The resistivity of the compounds is very high and is explained as due to the localization tendency of the electrons. The metal–insulator transition temperature shows a compositional dependence and has additional contributions apart from magnetism. The results are explained by the double exchange interaction and Mn2+/Mn3+ ratio, and also by taking into account the competition between the core-spin interaction and double exchange interaction.</jats:p>"

47649,"<jats:p>The structural, magnetic, and transport properties of the electron-doped perovskites cobalt oxides La1−xTexCoO3 (0⩽x⩽0.25) have been investigated. For the structural properties, the room temperature structural transition from rhombohedra (R3¯C) to orthorhombic (Pbnm) symmetry is found in these samples with x⩾0.10 by the Rietveld refinement of x-ray powder diffraction patterns, which is ascribed to the smaller ionic radius of Te. As for the magnetic properties, firstly the spin state transition of Co3+ ions is observed in all samples, and the transition temperature shifts up to higher temperature with Te doping, which is ascribed to the smaller ionic radius and the strong acidity of Te. Secondly, it is interesting that there exists paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase transition in the Te-doped samples. It is suggested that such a phase transition results from the introduction of Co2+ ions and the appearance of double exchange interaction between Co2+ and Co3+ due to Te doping. Moreover, Curie temperature TC increases with the increase of the Te doping level x (for x⩽0.10), and then decreases with the further increase of x. About the transport properties, the temperature dependence of the resistivity ρ shows that all samples display semiconducting behavior in the whole measured temperature region. And it can be seen that the resistivity first decreases with increasing Te doping level from x=0 to 0.10, then increases as x⩾0.15. Such variations of TC and ρ with x are suggested to be related to the structure transition.</jats:p>"

Building upon previous successes in forming stable SEI in conventional carbonate‐based electrolytes, here we report that reversible Li stripping/plating could be realized in triethyl phosphate (TEP), a known flame retardant. The critical enabling factor of our approach was the introduction of oxygen, which upon electrochemical reduction induces the initial decomposition of TEP and produces Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>PO<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> and poly‐phosphates.

To address this issue, herein, a new electrode architecture strategy based on conductive fibrous skeletons (CFS) is proposed. Lithium is impregnated into nickel/copper‐deposited conductive poly(ethylene terephthalate) nonwovens via electrochemical plating, resulting in self‐standing CFS–Li anodes. The CFS–Li anodes exhibit stable Li plating/stripping cyclability and mechanical deformability. To achieve high‐capacity flexible cathodes, over‐lithiated layered oxide (OLO) particles are compactly embedded in conductive heteronanomats (fibrous mixtures of multiwalled carbon nanotubes and functional polymer nanofibers). The conductive heteronanomats, as CFS of OLO cathodes, provide bicontinuous electron/ion conduction pathways without heavy metallic current collectors and chelate metal ions dissolved from OLO, thus improving the areal capacity, redox kinetics, and cycling retention.

Mo thin films are widely used as gate electrodes and electrodes in metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors. Tungsten (W) has primarily been used as a conventional gate electrode, but it suffers from reduced resistivity due to the residual fluorine component generated from the deposition process. Thus, herein, we developed a Mo thin film with low resistivity that can substitute W. The MoO2Cl2 precursor used to deposit the Mo thin film exists in a solid state. For solid precursors, the vapor pressure does not remain constant compared to that of liquid precursors, thereby making it difficult to set process conditions. Furthermore, the use of solid precursors at temperatures 600 °C and above has many limitations. Herein, H2 was used as the reactive gas for the deposition of Mo thin films, and the deposition temperature was increased to 650 °C, which was the maximum processing temperature of the aluminum nitride heater. Additionally, deposition rate, resistivity change, and surface morphology characteristics were compared. While resistivity decreased to 12.9 μΩ∙cm with the increase of deposition temperature from 600 °C to 650 °C, surface roughness (Rq) was increased to 0.560 nm with step coverage of 97%. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the crystallization change in the Mo thin film with increasing process temperature, and a certain thickness of the seed layer was required for nucleation on the initial wafer of the Mo thin film.

In an attempt to bridge the gap between insertion measurements in 3D composite electrode materials and that in an idealized pure model system, we studied the insertion and diffusion of Mg in a thin, massive layer of Sb deposited on Au by using PITT, CV, and potential step experiments.

The layered crystal structure of Sb leads should facilitate formation of such an intermetallic phase.

Results indicate the presence of both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic ordering processes in all alloys containing Gd. For ErNiAl, a metamagnetic transition from an antiferromagnetic ground state was observed. Within each alloy, several magnetic transitions occur over a temperature range from 10 K [in (Gd0.20Er0.80)NiAl] up to 35 K (in GdNiAl), with all but the lowest temperature transition shifting to higher temperatures with increasing Gd content. The change in magnetic entropy (ΔSmag) induced by a change in field is observed to peak around the Néel temperature for ErNiAl while gradually broadening and shifting toward the Curie temperature as the Gd content is increased. For Gd-rich alloys, a significant contribution to ΔSmag is observed at both the low and high temperature transitions, resulting in a rounded, skewed caret-like temperature profile of the magnetocaloric effect. Factors, which are believed to contribute to this effect, include the presence and temperature spacing of multiple zero-field transitions, which most likely result from competing anisotropy and exchange interactions within a frustrated hexagonal spin lattice. This leads to broad peaks in the magnetic heat capacity that span several transition temperatures, providing for a substantial ΔSmag over an extended temperature range. This characteristic is desired for application to magnetic refrigeration, where certain thermodynamic cycles (e.g., Ericsson cycle) require specific temperature profiles of the magnetocaloric effect in refrigerant materials (e.g., a constant change in magnetic entropy as a function of temperature within the region of cooling). In general, the best materials are those which supply the maximum amount of cooling over the widest temperature range.</jats:p>"
